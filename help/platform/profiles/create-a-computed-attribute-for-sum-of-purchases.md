# Create a computed attribute for the sum of purchases

Learn how to use computed attributes to sum the purchase amounts made by a user across multiple sales channels. A single customer might purchase on your website, in your mobile app, and in your brick-and-mortar store. With the computed attributes feature, you can sum the purchase amounts made by a customer across these channels and use this sum to define audiences and for other personalization. For more information, please visit the [computed attributes UI guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/profile/computed-attributes/ui.html?).
