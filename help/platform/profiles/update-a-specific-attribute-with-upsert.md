# Update specific profile attributes using `upsert`

Learn how to update a specific attribute of a profile using the `upsert` feature of Adobe Experience Platform. Usually, when you ingest a record into Platform with only the specific attribute, it updates the value but also updates the other attributes with `null` values. `Upsert` allows you to update just the desired attribute, while allowing the remaining fields to keep their current values.
