# Update specific profile attributes using upsert

Learn how to update a specific attribute of a profile using the upsert feature of Adobe Experience Platform. Usually, when you ingest a record into Platform with only the specific attribute, it updates the value but also updates the other attributes with NULL values. Upsert allows you to update just the desired attribute, while allowing the remaining fields to keep their current values.
