# Add developers and give permissions to API credentials

Learn how to add developers to Adobe Experience Platform-based applications like Real-Time Customer Data Platform and Journey Optimizer. Developers are first added in Admin Console. After they have created their Platform project in the Developer Console, their API credential is assigned permissions in the Platform or Journey Optimizer interface. For more information, please visit the [Access control documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/access-control/home.html).

>[!ADMIN]
>
>Only system administrators can add developers and assign permissions to API credentials. Product administrators cannot complete these tasks.

>[!TIP]
>
>We recommend you also add the developer as a **user** to the `AEP-Default-All-Users` product profile in Admin Console and then add them to the same role in the Platform interface as the API credential. This allows them to use the interface, if needed. See [Add users](add-users.md) for more details.
