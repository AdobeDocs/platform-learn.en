# Add product administrators

Learn how to add product administrators for Adobe Experience Platform. Product administrators manage access control for Platform-based applications like Real-Time Customer Data Platform and Journey Optimizer. They can create users, developers, and additional administrators in Admin Console and then grant them (and API credentials) permissions in the Platform or Journey Optimizer interface. For more information, please visit the [Access control documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/access-control/home.html).

>[!TIP]
>
>We recommend you also add the product administrator as a **user** to the `AEP-Default-All-Users` product profile in Admin Console and then add them to a role in the permissions screen in the Platform interface. See [Add users](add-users.md) for more details.
