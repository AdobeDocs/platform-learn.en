# Streaming data ingestion overview

Using Experience Platform's streaming ingestion you can be sure that any data you send will be available in the Real-Time Customer Profile. This data can be captured from CRM and ERP systems, or from any other source which is able to communicate over HTTP or public cloud streaming infrastructure. You can then use this data for real-time segmentation and to activate other marketing processes.
