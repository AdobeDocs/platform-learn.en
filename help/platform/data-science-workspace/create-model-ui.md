# Create and publish a trained model in the UI

In Adobe Experience Platform Data Science Workspace, a machine learning Model is created by incorporating an existing recipe that is appropriate for the modelâ€™s intent. The model is then trained and evaluated to optimize its operating efficiency and efficacy by fine-tuning its associated Hyperparameters. Recipes are reusable, meaning that multiple Models can be created and tailored to specific purposes with a single Recipe.

This tutorial walks through the steps to create, train, evaluate, and publish a model using a recipe made with the JupyterLab recipe builder notebook.
