# Copy schemas between sandboxes

This video shows how to copy a schema from one sandbox to another in Adobe Experience Platform using the Export/Import Schema API. Build and test your schemas in development sandboxes and then copy them to production. For more information, please visit the [schemas documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/xdm/home.html).

>[!TIP]
>
>A much easier, interface-centric process to move schemas and other objects between sandboxes was introduced in late 2023 which we recommend using instead. Please see [Copy objects between sandboxes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/admin/copy-objects-between-sandboxes.html).
