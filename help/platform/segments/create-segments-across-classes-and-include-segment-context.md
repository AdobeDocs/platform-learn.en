# Create Segments Across Classes and Include Segment Context

Segmentation across classes (multi-entity segmentation) allows you to build segments combining data based on both the XDM profile class and datasets built using *other XDM classes*.

Segment context (segment payload) allows you to provide key contextual details, such as a visitor's abandoned cart contents, in your segment definition so you can send personalized messages.
