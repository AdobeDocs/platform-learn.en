# Delete datasets and batches

Learn how to delete datasets and batches in Adobe Experience Platform. If a dataset needs to be removed from the system for any reason, such as cleaning up test datasets in lower environments or datasets that were added in error, you can simply delete that dataset and remove its contents from the data lake, identity graph, and profile store. Individual batches can be deleted from the data lake, but not from the identity graph and profile store.
