# Data Hygiene overview

Learn about the Data Hygiene feature of Adobe Experience Platform. 

Data Hygiene allows you to delete both consumers and entire datasets from all Experience Platform stores, such as the data lake, the profile service, and the identity service. You donâ€™t need to worry about where Adobe stores the data on the backend as you efficiently curate data for all of your Platform-based applications like Customer Journey Analytics, Journey Optimizer, and Real-time CDP. For more information, please visit the [data hygiene documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/hygiene/home.html).
