# Sources tutorials

Adobe Experience Platform enables data to be ingested from external sources while providing the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services. The list of available sources continues to grow and currently includes a wide variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, databases, and many others.

Each source can be configured using a RESTful API or an interactive UI that makes it easy to establish connections with various data providers. These connections enable you to authenticate your third-party systems, set times for ingestion runs, and manage data ingestion throughput.

A complete list of available sources, as well as step-by-step tutorials for connecting to each source via the Platform UI or the Flow Service API is available in the sources documentation.
