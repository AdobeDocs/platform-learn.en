# Ingest data using the Adobe Audience Manager data connector

As you reconfigure your processes and personnel to move from Adobe Audience Manager to Real-Time Customer Data Platform (Real-Time CDP), you can use the Audience Manager data connector to bring traits and segments from AAM into the Platform, combine them with other rich data (including PII), and send them out to destination partners. This video walks you through the configuration of the AAM data connector for Real-Time CDP.

>[!WARNING]
>
>In the video above, it shows an option of choosing ALL segments and/or traits. We do not recommend using this option unless you have a limited number of segments with an understood number of unique visitors in those segments. Bringing over large numbers of visitor profiles in "all segments" or "all traits" can balloon the profile service in Real-Time CDP, which can have a huge effect on pricing of the application (since number of profiles affect your cost of the application). It is recommended, therefore, that instead of choosing "all", you choose specific segments to bring over to Real-Time CDP.
