# Segment Match data governance

Learn how to set up and use data governance controls in Real-Time CDP so that you can limit which datasets (and therefore which segments that use those datasets) can be shared with data partners. For more information, please see the [documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/segmentation/ui/segment-match/overview){target="_blank"}.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Adobe introduced Segment Match in 2021 for customers to collaborate and exchange audiences. In early 2025, Adobe introduced Real-Time CDP Collaboration, which is the longer-term approach to meet this use-case.
>
> * For customers in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand: Adobe recommends Real-Time CDP Prime and Ultimate customers transition data collaboration use cases from Segment Match to Real-Time CDP Collaboration. View the [documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/real-time-cdp-collaboration/using/home){target="_blank"} and [quick-start guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/real-time-cdp-collaboration/using/quick-start-guide){target="_blank"} for Real-Time CDP Collaboration and contact your Adobe account team to learn more.
> * For customers in all other geographies: Segment Match is the recommended option until Real-Time CDP Collaboration is released in those geographies in 2026.
