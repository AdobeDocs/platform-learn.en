# Segment Match receiving data

With Segment Match, data can be shared to you by your strategic partners. In this video, learn how to approve and receive the data, and where you can see it and add it to your own segments. For more information, please see the [documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/segmentation/ui/segment-match/overview){target="_blank"}.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Adobe introduced Segment Match in 2021 for customers to collaborate and exchange audiences. In early 2025, Adobe introduced Real-Time CDP Collaboration, which is the longer-term approach to meet this use-case.
>
> * For customers in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand: Adobe recommends Real-Time CDP Prime and Ultimate customers transition data collaboration use cases from Segment Match to Real-Time CDP Collaboration. View the [documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/real-time-cdp-collaboration/using/home){target="_blank"} and [quick-start guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/real-time-cdp-collaboration/using/quick-start-guide){target="_blank"} for Real-Time CDP Collaboration and contact your Adobe account team to learn more.
> * For customers in all other geographies: Segment Match is the recommended option until Real-Time CDP Collaboration is released in those geographies in 2026.
