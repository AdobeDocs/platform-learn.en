# Create multi-entity audiences

This video shows you how to build multi-entity audiences in Adobe Experience Platform's audience rule builder.  Multi-entity segmentation, or segmentation across classes, allows you to build audiences combining data based on multiple XDM classes. For example, you could have a dataset built on the XDM ExperienceEvent class capturing product ids when customers make a purchase and another dataset built on a custom product class, containing the catalog details of each product id (e.g. color, size, category, etc). If you establish a relationship between the schemas, you can then build audiences based on fields existing in both schemas (e.g. people who bought jackets).

<!--Segment context (segment payload) allows you to provide key contextual details, such as a visitor's abandoned cart contents, in your segment definition so you can send personalized messages.-->
