# Use time constraints in segment definitions

Learn how to use the various date and time options in the Adobe Experience Platform audience builder interface. Use dates in profile attributes to build audiences for people having a birthday. Use dates in events to build audiences for people who made multiple purchases in a certain time frame or didn't take an action in a certain time frame. For more information, see the [Segment Builder UI guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/segmentation/ui/segment-builder).
