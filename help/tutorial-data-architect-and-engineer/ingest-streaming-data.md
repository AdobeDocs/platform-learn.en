# Ingest streaming data

<!--1hr-->

In this lesson, you will stream data using the Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK.

There are two main tasks we must complete in the Data Collection interface:

* We must implement Web SDK on the Luma website to send data about visitor activity from the website to the Adobe Edge network. We will do a simple implementation using tags (formerly Launch)

* We must configure a datastream, which tells the Edge network where to forward the data. We will configure it to send the data to our `Luma Web Events` dataset in our Platform sandbox.

**Data Engineers** will need to ingest streaming data outside of this tutorial. When implementing Adobe Experience Platform's Web or Mobile SDKs, typically a web or mobile developer is involved in the data layer creation and tag property configuration.

Before you begin the exercises, watch these two short videos to learn more about streaming data ingestion and Web SDK:

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/28425?learn=on)

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/34141?learn=on)

>[!NOTE]
>
>While this tutorial focuses on streaming ingestion from websites with Web SDK, you can also stream data using the [Adobe Mobile SDK](https://developer.adobe.com/client-sdks/documentation/), [Apache Kafka Connect](https://github.com/adobe/experience-platform-streaming-connect), and other mechanisms.

-->  

<!--## Create a streaming source

1. Log into the [Experience Platform  user interface](https://experience.adobe.com/platform/)
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Sources]** in the left navigation
1. Filter the list by selecting **[!UICONTROL Streaming]**
1. In the **[!UICONTROL HTTP API]** section, select the **[!UICONTROL Configure]** button
    ![Configure an HTTP API streaming source](assets/websdk-source-confiigureHTTPAPI.png)
1. On the **[!UICONTROL Authentication]** step, enter `Luma Web Events Source` as the **[!UICONTROL Account name]** and select the **[!UICONTROL Connect to source]** button (we don't need to enable authentication since the data will be originating from website visitors)
    ![Configure an HTTP API streaming source](assets/websdk-source-connectSource.png)
1. Once connected, select the **[!UICONTROL Next]** button to proceed to the next step in the workflow
1. On the **[!UICONTROL Select data]** step, choose **[!UICONTROL Existing Dataset]**, select your `Luma Web Events Dataset`, and then select the **[!UICONTROL Next]** button
    ![Select your dataset](assets/websdk-source-selectDataset.png)
1. On the **[!UICONTROL Dataflow detail]** step, select the **[!UICONTROL Next]** button:
    ![Select Next](assets/websdk-source-dataflowName.png)
    <!--What is a good practice for naming the data flow vs the source-->
<!--
1. On the **[!UICONTROL Review]** step, review your source details and select the **[!UICONTROL Finish]** button:
    ![Select Finish](assets/websdk-source-review.png)
-->

## Configure the datastream

First we will configure the datastream. A datastream tells the Adobe Edge network where to send the data after receiving it from the Web SDK call. For example, do you want to send the data to Experience Platform, Adobe Analytics, or Adobe Target? Datastreams are managed in the Data Collection user interface (formerly Launch) and are critical to data collection with Web SDK.

To create your [!UICONTROL datastream]:

1. Log into the [Experience Platform Data Collection user interface](https://experience.adobe.com/launch/)
    <!--when will the edge config go live?-->

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Datastreams]** in the left navigation
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL New Datastream]** button in the upper-right hand corner

    ![Select datastreams in the left navigation](assets/websdk-edgeConfig-clickNav.png)


1. For the **[!UICONTROL Friendly Name]**, enter `Luma Platform Tutorial` (add your name to the end, if multiple people from your company are taking this tutorial)
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Save]** button
   
    ![Name the datastram and save](assets/websdk-edgeConfig-name.png)

On the next screen, you specify where you want to send data. To send data to Experience Platform:

1. Toggle on **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform]** to expose additional fields
1. For **[!UICONTROL Sandbox]**, select `Luma Tutorial`
1. For **[!UICONTROL Event Dataset]**, select `Luma Web Events Dataset`
1. If you use other Adobe applications, feel free to explore the other sections to see which information is required in the Edge Configuration of these other solutions. Remember, Web SDK was developed not only to stream data into Experience Platform, but also to replace all previous JavaScript libraries used by other Adobe applications. The Edge Configuration is used to specify the account details of each application to which you want to send the data.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]** 
    ![Configure the datastream and save](assets/websdk-edgeConfig-addEnvironment.png)

Once the Edge Configuration has saved, the resulting screen will show three environments have been created for Development, Staging, and Production. Additional Development environments can be added:
    ![Each Edge Configuration can have multiple environments](assets/websdk-edgeConfig-environments.png)
All three environments contain the Platform details you just entered. However, these details can be configured differently per environment. For example, you could have each environment send data to a different Platform sandbox. In this tutorial, we will not do any additional customization to our datastream.

## Install the Web SDK Extension

### Add a property

First we must create a tag property (formerly a tag property). A property is a container for all the JavaScript, rules, and other features required to collect details from a web page and send it to various locations.

To create a property:

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Properties]** in the left navigation
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL New Property]** button
    ![Add a new property](assets/websdk-property-addNewProperty.png)
1. As the **[!UICONTROL Name]**, enter `Luma Platform Tutorial` (add your name to the end, if multiple people from your company are taking this tutorial)
1. As the **[!UICONTROL Domains]**, enter `enablementadobe.com` (explained later)
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]**
    ![Property details](assets/websdk-property-propertyDetails.png)

<!--
After saving the property, you might see an error message like the one below. If so, this is because you don't actually have access to the property you just created. To fix this, we need to go to the Admin Console to give yourself access:
    ![Error after saving the profile](assets/websdk-property-errorCreating.png)

To give yourself access to the property:

1. In a separate browser tab, log into the [Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/)
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Products]** from the top navigation
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform Launch]** on the left navigation
1. Go to your `Luma Tutorial Launch` product profile
1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Permissions]** tab
1. On the **[!UICONTROL Properties]** row, select **[!UICONTROL Edit]**
    ![Edit the Property Permissions](assets/websdk-adminconsole-editPermissions.png)
1. Select the "+" icon to move your `Luma Platform Tutorial` property to the right-hand side and select the **[!UICONTROL Save]** button to update the permissions
   
    ![Add the new property](assets/websdk-adminconsole-addProperty.png)

Now switch back to your browser tab with the Data Collection interface still open. Reload the page and the `Luma Platform Tutorial` property should display in the list. Select to open the property:

![Luma Platform Tutorial should appear](assets/websdk-property-showsInList.png)
-->

## Add the Web SDK extension

Now that you have a property you can add the Web SDK using an extension. An extension is a package of code that extends the Data Collection interface and functionality. To add the extension:

1. Open your tag property
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Extensions]** in the left navigation
1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** tab
1. There are many extensions available for tags. Filter the catalog with the term `Web SDK`
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK]** extension, select the **[!UICONTROL Install]** button
    ![Install the Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK extension](assets/websdk-property-addExtension.png)    
1. There are several configurations available for the Web SDK extension, but there only two we are going to configure for this tutorial. Update the **[!UICONTROL Edge Domain]** to `data.enablementadobe.com`. This setting allows you to set first party cookies with your Web SDK implementation, which is encouraged. Later in this lesson, you will map a website on the `enablementadobe.com` domain to your tag property. The CNAME for the `enablementadobe.com` domain has already been configured so that `data.enablementadobe.com` will forward to Adobe servers. When you implement Web SDK on your own website, you will need to create a CNAME for your own data collection purposes, for example, `data.YOUR_DOMAIN.com`
1. From the **[!UICONTROL Datastream]** dropdown, select your `Luma Platform Tutorial` datastream.
1. Feel free to look at the other configuration options (but don't change them!) and then select **[!UICONTROL Save]**
    <!--is edge domain required for first party? when will it break?-->
   <!--any other fields that should be highlighted-->
    ![](assets/websdk-property-configureExtension.png)
 
    

## Create a rule to send data

Now we will create a rule to send data to Platform. A rule is a combination of events, conditions, and actions that tell tags to do something. To create a rule:

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Rules]** in the left navigation
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Create New Rule]** button
    ![Create a rule](assets/websdk-property-createRule.png)
1. Name the rule `All Pages - Library Loaded`
1. Under **[!UICONTROL Events]**, select the **[!UICONTROL Add]** button
    ![Name the rule and add an event](assets/websdk-property-nameRule.png)   
1. Use the **[!UICONTROL Core]** **[!UICONTROL Extension]** and select **[!UICONTROL Library Loaded (Page Top)]** as the **[!UICONTROL Event Type]**. This setting means that our rule fires whenever the Launch library loads on a page.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Keep Changes]** to return to the main rule screen
    ![Add the Library Loaded event](assets/websdk-property-addEvent.png)    
1. Leave **[!UICONTROL Conditions]** empty, since we want this rule to fire on all pages, as per the name we gave it
1. Under **[!UICONTROL Actions]**, select the **[!UICONTROL Add]** button
1. Use the **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK]** **[!UICONTROL Extension]** and select **[!UICONTROL Send Event]** as the **[!UICONTROL Action Type]**
1. On the right, select **[!UICONTROL web.webpagedetails.pageViews]** from the **[!UICONTROL Type]** dropdown. This is one of the XDM fields in our `Luma Web Events Schema`
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Keep Changes]** to return to the main rule screen
    ![Add the Send Event action](assets/websdk-property-addAction.png)
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]** to save the rule    
    ![Save the rule](assets/websdk-property-saveRule.png)   

## Publish the rule in a library

Next we will publish the rule to our development environment so we can verify that it works.

<!--
There are a few quick steps we must take in the **[!UICONTROL Publishing]** section of Launch.


### Create a host

Launch libraries can be hosted on Adobe's Content Delivery Network (CDN) or on your own servers. In this tutorial, we will use Adobe's CDN since it is faster to set up:

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Hosts]** in the left navigation
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Create New Host]** button
    ![Create a new host](assets/websdk-property-createHost.png)   
1. For the **[!UICONTROL Name]**, enter `Adobe CDN`
1. For the **[!UICONTROL Type]**, select **[!UICONTROL Managed by Adobe]**
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Save]** button to complete the setup of the host
    ![Configure the host](assets/websdk-property-hostDetails.png)   

### Create an environment

Environments allow you to have different versions of a library in different publishing environments to accommodate your publishing workflow. For example, the fully tested version of your library can be published to a Production environment, while new changes are being created in a Development environment. You can also use different hosts for each environment. To create an environment:

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Environments]** in the left navigation
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Create New Environment]** button
    ![Create a new environment](assets/websdk-property-createEnvironment.png) 
1. Under **[!UICONTROL Development]** select **[!UICONTROL Select]**   
    ![Select the environment type](assets/websdk-property-selectEnvironment.png) 
1. For the **[!UICONTROL Name]**, enter `Development`
1. For the **[!UICONTROL Select Host]** dropdown, select `Adobe CDN`
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Save]** button to complete the setup of the environment
    ![Configure the environment](assets/websdk-property-configureEnv.png)
1. You will see a modal with URL and other implementation details of this library. These are critical for a real Launch implementation, but we don't need to worry about them for this tutorial. Select the **[!UICONTROL Close]** button to exit the modal.

### Create and publish the library

Now let's bundle the contents of our property&mdash;currently an extension and a rule&mdash;into a library. 
-->

To create a library:

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Publishing Flow]** in the left navigation
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Add Library]**
    ![Select Add Library](assets/websdk-property-pubAddNewLib.png)
1. For the **[!UICONTROL Name]**, enter `Luma Platform Tutorial`
1. For the **[!UICONTROL Environment]**, select `Development`
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Add All Changed Resources]** button. (In addition to the [!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK] extension and the `All Pages - Library Loaded` rule, you will also see the [!UICONTROL Core] extension added which contains the base JavaScript required by all Launch web properties.)
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Save & Build for Development]** button 
    ![Create and build the library](assets/websdk-property-buildLibrary.png)

The library may take a few minutes to build and when it is complete it displays a green dot to the left of the library name:
    ![Build complete](assets/websdk-property-buildComplete.png)   

As you can see on the [!UICONTROL Publishing Flow] screen, there is a lot more to the publishing process which is beyond the scope of this tutorial. We are just going to use a single library in our Development environment.

## Validate the data in the request

### Add the Adobe Experience Platform Debugger

The Experience Platform Debugger is an extension available for Chrome and Firefox browsers which helps you see the Adobe technology implemented in your web pages. Download the version for your preferred browser:

* [Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adobe-experience-platform-dbg/)
* [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adobe-experience-platform/bfnnokhpnncpkdmbokanobigaccjkpob)

If you've never used the Debugger before&mdash;and this one is different from the older Adobe Experience Cloud Debugger&mdash;you might want to watch this five-minute overview video:

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/32156?learn=on)

### Open the Luma website

For this tutorial, we use a publicly hosted version of the Luma demo website. Let's open it and bookmark it:

 1. In a new browser tab, open the [Luma website](https://luma.enablementadobe.com/content/luma/us/en.html). 
 1. Bookmark the page for use throughout the rest of the tutorial

This hosted website is why we used `enablementadobe.com` in the [!UICONTROL Domains] field of our initial tag property configuration and why we used `data.enablementadobe.com` as our first-party domain in the [!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK] extension. See, I had a plan!

![Luma homepage](assets/websdk-luma-homepage.png)   

### Use the Experience Platform Debugger to map to your tag property

The Experience Platform Debugger has a cool feature that allows you to replace an existing tag property with a different one. This is useful for validation and allows us to skip many implementation steps in this tutorial.

1. Make sure you have the Luma site open and select the Experience Platform Debugger extension icon
1. The Debugger will open and show some details of the hardcoded implementation, which is unrelated to this tutorial (you may need to reload the Luma site after opening the Debugger)
1. Confirm that the Debugger is "**[!UICONTROL Connected to Luma]**" as pictured below and then select the "**[!UICONTROL lock]**" icon to lock the Debugger to the Luma site.
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Sign In]** button on the top right to authenticate.
1. Now go to **[!UICONTROL Launch]** in the left navigation
1. Select the Configuration tab
1. To the right of where it shows you the **[!UICONTROL Page Embed Codes]**, open the **[!UICONTROL Actions]** dropdown, and select **[!UICONTROL Replace]**
    ![Select Actions > Replace](assets/websdk-debugger-replaceLibrary.png)
1. Since you are authenticated, the Debugger is going to pull in your available Launch properties and environments. Select your `Luma Platform Tutorial` property
1. Select your `Development` environment
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Apply]** button
    ![Select the alternate tag property](assets/websdk-debugger-selectProperty.png)
1. The Luma website will now reload _with your tag property_. Help, I've been hacked! Just kidding.
    ![tag property replaced](assets/websdk-debugger-propertyReplaced.png)
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Summary]** in the left navigation, to see the details of your [!UICONTROL Launch] property
    ![Summary tab](assets/websdk-debugger-summary.png)
1. Now go to **[!UICONTROL AEP Web SDK]** in the left navigation to see the **[!UICONTROL Network Requests]**
1. Open the **[!UICONTROL events]** row

    ![Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK request](assets/websdk-debugger-platformNetwork.png)
1. Note how we can see the `web.webpagedetails.pageView` event type we specified in our [!UICONTROL Send Event] action, and other, out-of-the-box variables adhering to the `AEP Web SDK ExperienceEvent Mixin` format
    ![Event details](assets/websdk-debugger-eventDetails.png)   
1. These types of request details are also visible in the browser's web developer tools **Network** tab. Open it and reload the page. Filter for calls with `interact` to locate the call, select it, and then look in the **Headers** tab, **Request Payload** area.
    ![Netowrk tab](assets/websdk-debugger-networkTab.png)   
1. Go to the **Response** tab and note how the ECID value is included in the response. Copy this value as you will use it to validate the profile information in the next exercise.
    ![Netowrk tab](assets/websdk-debugger-networkTab-response.png)   



## Validate the data in Experience Platform

You can validate that data is landing in Platform by looking at the batches of data arriving in the `Luma Web Events Dataset`. (I know, it's called streaming data ingestion but now I'm saying it arrives in batches! It streams in real-time to Profile, so it can be used for real-time segmentation and activation, but is sent in batches every 15 minutes to the data lake.)

To validate the data:

1. In the Platform user interface, go to **[!UICONTROL Datasets]** in the left navigation
1. Open the `Luma Web Events Dataset` and confirm that a batch has arrived. Remember, they are sent every 15 minutes, so you might need to wait for the batch to show up.
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Preview dataset]** button
    ![Open the dataset](assets/websdk-platform-dataset.png)
1. In the preview modal, note how you can select different fields of the schema on the left to preview those specific data points:
    ![Preview the fields](assets/websdk-platform-datasetPreview.png)   

You can also confirm that the new profile is showing up:

1. In the Platform user interface, go to **[!UICONTROL Profiles]** in the left navigation
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL ECID]** namespace and search for your ECID value (copy it from the respon. The profile will have its own id, separate from the ECID. 
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Profile ID]** to open the profile
    ![Find and open the profile](assets/websdk-platform-openProfile.png)
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Events]** tab to see the pages you viewed
    ![Profile Events](assets/websdk-platform-profileEvents.png)   
    <!--![](assets/websdk-platform-confirmProfile.png)-->  

## Add custom data to the event

### Create a data element for page name

1. In the Data Collection tags interface, on the top-right corner of your `Luma Platform Tutorial` property, open the **[!UICONTROL Select a Working Library]** dropdown and select your `Luma Platform Tutorial` library. This setting makes it easier to publish additional updates to our library.
1. Now go to **[!UICONTROL Data Elements]** in the left navigation
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Create New Data Element]** button

    ![Create a new data element](assets/websdk-property-createNewDataElement.png)   
1. As the **[!UICONTROL Name]**, enter `Page Name` 
1. As the **[!UICONTROL Data Element Type]**, select `JavaScript Variable`
1. As the **[!UICONTROL JavaScript variable name]**, enter `digitalData.page.pageInfo.pageName`
1. To help standardize the format of the values, check the boxes for **[!UICONTROL Force lowercase value]** and **[!UICONTROL Clean text]**
1. Make sure that `Luma Platform Tutorial` is selected as the working library
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Save to Library]**
    ![Create a data element for page name](assets/websdk-property-dataElement-pageName.png) 

### Map the page name to the XDM Object data element

Now we will map our page name to the Web SDK. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>In order to complete this task, we need to make sure that your user first has access to the Prod sandbox. If you don't already have access to the Prod sandbox from a different product profile, quickly open your `Luma Tutorial Platform` profile and add the permission item **[!UICONTROL Sandboxes]** > **[!UICONTROL Prod]**. After doing so, do a SHIFT-Reload on the Data Elements page to clear your cache
>![Add the Prod sandbox](assets/websdk-property-permissionToLoadSchema.png)

On the **[!UICONTROL Data Elements]** page:

1. Create a new data element 
1. As the **[!UICONTROL Name]**, enter `XDM Object`
1. As the **[!UICONTROL Extension]**, select `Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK`
1. As the **[!UICONTROL Data Element Type]**, select `XDM object`
1. As the **[!UICONTROL Sandbox]**, select your `Luma Tutorial` sandbox
1. As the **[!UICONTROL Schema]**, select your `Luma Web Events Schema`
1. Select the `web.webPageDetails.name` field
1. As the **[!UICONTROL Value]**, select the icon to open the data element selection modal and choose your `Page Name` data element
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Save to Library]**
    ![Map the page name to the XDM Object data element](assets/websdk-property-dataElement-createXDMObject.png)   

This same process is used to map additional custom data on your website to XDM fields.

### Add the XDM data to your Send Event action

Now that you have data mapped to XDM fields, you can include it in your Send Event action:

1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Rules]** screen
1. Open your `All Pages - Library Loaded` rule
1. Open the `Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK - Send Event` action
1. As the **[!UICONTROL XDM data]**, select the icon to open the data element selection modal and choose your `XDM Object` data element
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Keep Changes]** button
    ![Add the XDM data to your Send Event action](assets/websdk-property-addXDMtoSendEvent.png)
1. Now, since you have had `Luma Platform Tutorial` selected as your working library for the last several exercises, your recent changes have been saving directly to the library. Instead of having to publish our changes via the Publishing Flow screen, you can just open the dropdown on the blue button and select **[!UICONTROL Save to Library and Build]**
    ![Save to Library and Build](assets/websdk-property-saveAndBuildUpdatedSendEvent.png)

This starts building a new tag library with the three changes you just made.

### Validate the XDM data

You should now be able to reload the Luma homepage, while mapped to your tag property using the Debugger as you learned earlier, and see that the page name field populates in the request!
    ![Validate the XDM data](assets/websdk-debugger-pageName.png)

You can also validate the page name data was received in Platform, by previewing the dataset and profile.

## Send additional identities

Your Web SDK implementation is now sending events with the Experience Cloud ID (ECID) as the primary identifier. The ECID is generated automatically by the Web SDK and is unique per device and browser. A single customer can have multiple ECIDs depending on which device and browser they are using. So how can we get a unified view of this customer and link their online activity to our CRM, Loyalty, and Offline Purchase data? We do that by collecting additional identities during their session and deterministically linking their profile via identity stitching.

If you recall, I mentioned that we would be using the ECID and CRM Id as identities for our web data in the [Map Identities](map-identities.md) lesson. So let's collect the CRM Id with the Web SDK!

### Add Data Element for the CRM Id

First we store the CRM Id in a data element:

1. In the tags interface, add a data element named `CRM Id`
1. As the **[!UICONTROL Data Element Type]**, select **[!UICONTROL JavaScript Variable]**
1. As the **[!UICONTROL JavaScript variable name]**, enter `digitalData.user.0.profile.0.attributes.username`
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Save to Library]** button (`Luma Platform Tutorial` should still be your working library)
    ![Add Data Element for the CRM Id](assets/websdk-property-dataElement-crmId.png)

### Add the CRM Id to the Identity Map data element

Now that we have captured the CRM Id value, we must associate it with a special data element type called the [!UICONTROL Identity Map] data element:

1. Add a data element named `Identities`
1. As the **[!UICONTROL Extension]**, select **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK]**
1. As the **[!UICONTROL Data Element Type]**, select **[!UICONTROL Identity map]**
1. As the **[!UICONTROL Namespace]**, enter `Luma CRM Id`, which is the [!UICONTROL namespace] we created in an earlier lesson

   >[!WARNING]
   >
   >The Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK extension version 2.2 allows you to select Namespace from a pre-populated dropdown using the actual values in your Platform account. Unfortunately, this feature is not yet "sandbox aware" and thus the `Luma CRM Id` value may not appear in the dropdown. This may prevent you from completing this exercise. We will post a workaround once confirmed.

1. As the **[!UICONTROL ID]**, select the icon to open the data element selection modal and choose your `CRM Id` data element
1. As the **[!UICONTROL Authenticated State]**, select **[!UICONTROL Authenticated]**
1. Leave **[!UICONTROL Primary]** _unchecked_. Since the CRM Id is not present for most visitors to the Luma website, you definitely _do not want to override the ECID as the primary identifier_. It would be a rare use case to use anything other than the ECID as the primary identifier. Usually I don't mention the default settings in these instructions, but I am calling this one out to help you avoid headaches later on in your own implementation.
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Save to Library]** button (`Luma Platform Tutorial` should still be your working library)
    ![Add the CRM Id to the Identity Map data element](assets/websdk-property-dataElement-identityMap.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can pass multiple identifiers using the [!UICONTROL Identity map] data type.

### Add the Identity map data element to the XDM Object

There is one more data element we must update&mdash;the XDM Object data element. It may seem weird to have to update three separate data elements to pass this one identity, but this process is designed to scale for multiple identities. Don't worry, we're almost done with this lesson!

1. Open your XDM Object data element
1. Open the IdentityMap XDM field
1. As the **[!UICONTROL Data element]**, select the icon to open the data element selection modal and choose your `Identities` data element
1. Now, since you have had `Luma Platform Tutorial` selected as your working library for the last several exercises, your recent changes have been saving directly to the library. Instead of having to publish our changes via the Publishing Flow screen, you can open the dropdown on the blue button and select **[!UICONTROL Save to Library and Build]**

### Validate the identity

To validate that the CRM Id is now being sent by the Web SDK:

1. Open the [Luma website](https://luma.enablementadobe.com/content/luma/us/en.html)
1. Map it to your tag property using the Debugger, as per the earlier instructions
1. Select the **Login** link on the top right of the Luma website
1. Log in using the credentials `test@adobe.com`/`test`
1. Once authenticated, inspect the Experience Platform Web SDK call in the Debugger (**[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK]** > **[!UICONTROL Network Requests]** > **[!UICONTROL events]** of the most recent request) and you should see the `lumaCrmId`:

1. Look up the user profile using the ECID namespace and value again. In the profile, you will see the CRM Id and also the Loyalty Id and the profile details like the name and phone number. All identities and data have been stitched together into a single, real-time customer profile!

* [Streaming Ingestion API reference](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-platform-apis/references/streaming-ingestion/)

Great job! That was a lot of information about Web SDK and Launch. There is a lot more involved in a full-blown implementation, but those are the basics to help you get started and see the results in Platform.
