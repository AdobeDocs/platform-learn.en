# Overview

_Getting Started with Adobe Experience Platform for Data Architects and Data Engineers_ is the perfect starting point for Data Architects and Data Engineers to get hands-on with Experience Platform.

The roles of the Data Architect and Data Engineer are intertwined in a Platform deployment. The Data Architect designs a schema which the Data Engineer uses to map the data they ingest. Because of this co-dependent relationship, this tutorial takes you through the key tasks executed by both roles to provide a comprehensive overview of a Platform deployment. Along the way we will point out which role needs to accomplish which task, so you will know when to pay attention and take notes.
