# Implement Adobe Experience Cloud with Web SDK tutorial

Learn how to implement Experience Cloud applications using Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK.

Experience Platform Web SDK is a client-side JavaScript library that allows customers of Adobe Experience Cloud to interact with both Adobe applications and third-party services through the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network. See [Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK Overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/edge/home) for more detailed information.

This tutorial guides you through the implementation of the Platform Web SDK on a sample retail website called Luma. The [Luma site](https://luma.enablementadobe.com/content/luma/us/en.html) has a rich data layer and functionality that lets you build a realistic implementation. For this tutorial, you:

* Create your own tags property, in your own account, with a Platform Web SDK implementation for the Luma website.
* Configure all data collection features for Web SDK implementations such as datastreams, schemas, and identity namespaces.
* Add the following Adobe Experience Cloud applications:
  * **[Adobe Experience Platform](setup-experience-platform.md)** (and applications built on Platform such as Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform, Adobe Journey Optimizer, and Adobe Customer Journey Analytics)
  * **[Adobe Analytics](setup-analytics.md)**
  * **[Adobe Audience Manager](setup-audience-manager.md)**
  * **[Adobe Target](setup-target.md)**
* Implement event forwarding to send the data collected by Web SDK to non-Adobe destinations.
* Validate your own Platform Web SDK implementation using Experience Platform Debugger and Assurance.

After completing this tutorial, you should be ready to start implementing all of your marketing applications through Platform Web SDK on your own website!

## Prerequisites

All Experience Cloud customers can use Platform Web SDK. It is not a requirement to license a Platform-based application like Real-Time Customer Data Platform or Journey Optimizer to use Web SDK.

In these lessons, it is assumed that you have an Adobe account and the required permissions to complete the lessons. If not, you must reach out to an Experience Cloud Administrator at your company to obtain access.

* For **Data Collection**, you must have:
  * **[!UICONTROL Platforms]**&mdash;permission for **[!UICONTROL Web]** and, if licensed, **[!UICONTROL Edge]**
  * **[!UICONTROL Property Rights]**&mdash;permission to **[!UICONTROL Approve]**, **[!UICONTROL Develop]**, **[!UICONTROL Edit Property]**, **[!UICONTROL Manage Environments]**, **[!UICONTROL Manage Extensions]**, and **[!UICONTROL Publish]**, 
  * **[!UICONTROL Company Rights]**&mdash;permission to **[!UICONTROL Manage Properties]**
  
    For more information concerning tag permissions, see [the documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/tags/admin/user-permissions).

* For **Experience Platform**, you must have:

  * Access to the **default production**, **"Prod"** sandbox. 
  * Access to **[!UICONTROL Manage Schemas]** and **[!UICONTROL View Schemas]** under **[!UICONTROL Data Modeling]**.
  * Access to **[!UICONTROL Manage Identity Namespaces]** and **[!UICONTROL View Identity Namespaces]** under **[!UICONTROL Identity Management]**.
  * Access to **[!UICONTROL Manage Datastreams]** and **[!UICONTROL View Datastreams]** under **[!UICONTROL Data Collection]**.
  * If you are a customer of a Platform-based application and will be completing the [Set up Experience Platform](setup-experience-platform.md) lesson, you should also have:
    * Access to a **development** sandbox.
    * All permission items under **[!UICONTROL Data Management]**, and **[!UICONTROL Profile Management]**:

    The required features should be available to all Experience Cloud customers, even if you are not a customer of a Platform-based application like Real-Time CDP.

    For more information on Platform access control, see [the documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/access-control/home).  

* For the optional **Adobe Analytics** lesson, you must have [admin access to Report Suite Settings, Processing Rules, and Analysis Workspace](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/admin/admin-console/home)

* For the optional **Adobe Target** lesson, you must have [Editor or Approver](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/target/using/administer/manage-users/enterprise/properties-overview#section_8C425E43E5DD4111BBFC734A2B7ABC80) access.

* For the optional **Audience Manager** lesson, you must have access to create, read, and write traits, segments, and destinations. For more information, refer to the tutorial on [Audience Manager's Role-Based Access Control](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/audience-manager-learn/tutorials/setup-and-admin/user-management/setting-permissions-with-role-based-access-control).


>[!NOTE]

>It is assumed that you are familiar with front-end development languages like HTML and JavaScript. You do not need to be an expert in these languages, but you get more out of this tutorial if you can read and understand code.
