* Have permission to **[!UICONTROL Develop]**, **[!UICONTROL Edit]**, **[!UICONTROL Approve]**, **[!UICONTROL Publish]**, **[!UICONTROL Manage Extensions]**, and **[!UICONTROL Manage Environments]** tag properties. For more information tags permissions, see [the documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/admin/user-permissions.html).
* If you will be completing the optional event forwarding lesson, have a product license which includes edge forwarding and permission item **[!UICONTROL Platforms]** > **[!UICONTROL Edge]**

* Have at least the following permission items in Adobe Experience Platform. These features are provisioned when you [request access to Data Collection](http://adobe.ly/websdkaccess)). One provisioned, assign access control in the [Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com):
