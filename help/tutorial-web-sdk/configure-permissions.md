# Configure permissions for the tutorial

Learn how to request access to Experience Platform Web SDK and configure the permission required to complete this tutorial. To implement Platform Web SDK using tags in the Data Collection interface, you must have the proper user permissions configured in [Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com).

## Data Collection

* Have permission to **[!UICONTROL Develop]**, **[!UICONTROL Edit]**, **[!UICONTROL Approve]**, **[!UICONTROL Publish]**, **[!UICONTROL Manage Extensions]**, and **[!UICONTROL Manage Environments]** tag properties. For more information tags permissions, see [the documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/admin/user-permissions.html).
* If you will be completing the optional event forwarding lesson, have a product license which includes edge forwarding and permission item **[!UICONTROL Platforms]** > **[!UICONTROL Edge]**

## Experience Platform

These features should be available to all Experience Cloud customers, even if you are not a customer of a Platform-based application like Real-time CDP.

* Access to the **default production** sandbox. 
* Access to **[!UICONTROL Manage Schemas]** and **[!UICONTROL View Schemas]** under **[!UICONTROL Data Modeling]**
* Access to **[!UICONTROL Manage Identity Namespaces]** and **[!UICONTROL View Identity Namespaces]** under **[!UICONTROL Identity Management]**
* Access to **[!UICONTROL Manage Datastreams]** and **[!UICONTROL View Datastreams]** under **[!UICONTROL Data Collection]**
* If you are a customer of a Platform-based application and will be completing the [Set up Experience Platform](setup-experience-platform.md) lesson, you should also have:
  * Access to a **development** sandbox.
  * All permission items under **[!UICONTROL Data Management]**, and **[!UICONTROL Profile Management]**:

## Adobe Analytics

For the optional Adobe Analytics lesson, you must have [admin access to Report Suite Settings, Processing Rules, and Analysis Workspace](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/admin/admin-console/home.html)

## Adobe Target

For the optional Adobe Target lesson, you must have [Editor or Approver](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/administer/manage-users/enterprise/properties-overview.html#section_8C425E43E5DD4111BBFC734A2B7ABC80) access.

## Adobe Audience Manager

* For the optional Audience Manager lesson, you must have access to create, read, and write traits, segments, and destinations. For more information, refer to the tutorial on [Audience Manager's Role-Based Access Control](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager-learn/tutorials/setup-and-admin/user-management/setting-permissions-with-role-based-access-control.html?lang=en).

Now you are ready to start the initial configuration steps.
