# Conclusion and next steps

Congratulations! You have completed the "Implement Adobe Experience Cloud with Web SDK" tutorial!

Let's quickly review all that you have accomplished. You have:

* Created a schema using standard and custom field groups.
* Configured a datastream.
* Built a tag property.
* Captured fields from a data layer, transformed them to XDM, and sent them to Platform Edge Network.
* Captured consent and authenticated identities.
* Connected the Web SDK implementation to the following Experience Cloud applications:
  * Adobe Experience Platform
  * Adobe Analytics
  * Adobe Audience Manager
  * Adobe Target
* Used event forwarding to send data from Platform Edge Network to a web hook.
* Validated the implementation using Adobe Experience Platform Debugger.

You are ready to begin the next phase of your journey&mdash;implementing Adobe Experience Cloud in your own website!

And there is always more to learn! Here are some suggestions of other content to build upon your implementation:


* **Trigger a journey in Journey Optimizer**. The events you implemented in the Luma website can be used to trigger journeys. Learn more in this [video tutorial](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer-learn/tutorials/create-journeys/use-case-transactional-journey.html).
* **Connect Customer Journey Analytics**. If you created the [Platform dataset](setup-experience-platform.md), you can connect the dataset to Customer Journey Analytics. Learn more in this [video tutorial](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/customer-journey-analytics-learn/tutorials/connecting-customer-journey-analytics-to-data-sources-in-platform.html)
* **Build a segment in Platform**. If you enabled your [schema and dataset for Real-Time Customer Profile](setup-experience-platform.md), you can build segments based on your web events, combine them with data from other sources and then send these segments to destinations in Real-Time Customer Data Platform. Learn more about the segment builder in this [video tutorial](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/segments/create-segments.html).
* **Implement Platform Mobile SDK**. Now that you've mastered one SDK, learn another! The Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK is used to power Experience Cloud and third-party services on mobile apps. There is a similar [hands-on tutorial for Mobile SDK](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/implement-mobile-sdk/overview.html). Complete both and see profiles merge across devices!
* **Learn more about Experience Platform**. Learn more about how to ingest data from other sources and combine that with your Web SDK data, in [Getting Started with Adobe Experience Platform for Data Architects and Data Engineers](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/getting-started-for-data-architects-and-data-engineers/overview.html)
