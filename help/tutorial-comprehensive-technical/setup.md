## Overview


In order to take all of these tutorials in a hands-on way, the following Adobe Experience Cloud applications need to be provisioned in your IMS Org:

- Adobe Real-time CDP
- Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection

If a specific application service isn't provisioned for your IMS Org, then you won't be able to take that specific exercise in hands-on way.
