# 12.4 Design a trigger-based Customer Journey

In this exercise, you'll create an orchestrated journey by making use of Journey Orchestration in combination with Adobe Experience Platform.

Go to [https://experience.adobe.com/](https://experience.adobe.com/)

You'll see the **Adobe Experience Cloud** homepage.

![Demo](./images/aec.png)

Click on **Journey Orchestration**.

![Demo](./images/aecjo.png)

Next, you'll see the **Journey Orchestration** homepage, which shows all existing Journeys.

![Demo](./images/journeyhome.png)

Click **Create** to start creating your Journey.

![Demo](./images/jocreate.png)

You'll then see a new, blank Journey.

![Demo](./images/jonew.png)

You should first name your Journey.

As a Name for the Journey, use `Geofence Entry Journey LDAP` and replace `LDAP` with LDAP. In this example, the Journey Name is `Geofence Entry Journey vangeluw`. No other values must be set at this moment.

![Demo](./images/joname.png)

Click **OK**.

![Demo](./images/jonameok.png)

On the left side of your screen, have a look at **Events**. You should see your previously create Event in that list. Select it, then drag and drop it on the Journey Canvas.

![Demo](./images/joevents.png)

Your Journey then looks like this:

![Demo](./images/jo1.png)

Next, click on **Orchestration**.

![Demo](./images/jo2.png)

You now see **Orchestration** capabilities.

![Demo](./images/jo3.png)

Select **Condition**, then drag and drop it on the Journey Canvas.

![Demo](./images/jo4.png)

You now have to define three conditions:

* It's colder than 10° Celsius
* It's between 10° and 25° Celsius
* It's warmer than 25° Celsius

Let's define the first condition.

## Condition 1: Colder than 10° Celsius

Click on the **Condition**.

![Demo](./images/jo5.png)

Click on the **Edit** icon for the expression of Path1.

![Demo](./images/jo6.png)

You'll then see an empty **Simple Editor** screen.

![Demo](./images/jo7.png)

Our query will be a bit more advanced, so we'll need the **Advanced Mode**.
Click **Advanced Mode**.

![Demo](./images/jo8.png)

You'll then see the **Advanced Editor** which allows code entry.

![Demo](./images/jo9.png)

Select the below code and paste it in the **Advanced Editor**.

`#{weatherApiLdap.WeatherByCityLdap.main.temp} <= 10` (replace Ldap by your LDAP)

You'll then see this.

![Demo](./images/jo10.png)

In order to retrieve the temperature as part of this Condition, you need to provide the city in which the customer currently is.
The **City** needs to be linked to the dynamic parameter `q`, just like we saw previously in the Open Weather API Documentation.

Click the field **dynamic val: q** as indicated in the screenshot.

![Demo](./images/jo11.png)

You then need to find the field that contains the current city of the customer in one of the available Data Sources.

![Demo](./images/jo12.png)

You can find the field by navigating to ```geofenceEntryLdap.--aepTenantId--.locationService.currentPoiCity``` (replace Ldap by your LDAP).

By clicking that field, it will be added as the dynamic value for the parameter `q`. This field will be populated by for instance the geolocation-service that you've implemented in your Mobile App.

![Demo](./images/jo13.png)

Click **OK**.

![Demo](./images/jook.png)

Next, we'll add the 2nd condition.

## Condition 2: Between 10° and 25° Celsius

After having added the first condition, you'll see this screen.

![Demo](./images/joc2.png)

Click **Add Path**.

![Demo](./images/joadd.png)

Click on the **Edit** icon for the expression of Path2.

![Demo](./images/joc6.png)

You'll then see an empty **Simple Editor** screen.

![Demo](./images/jo7.png)

Our query will be a bit more advanced, so we'll need the **Advanced Mode**.
Click **Advanced Mode**.

![Demo](./images/jo8.png)

You'll then see the **Advanced Editor** which allows code entry.

![Demo](./images/jo9.png)

Select the below code and paste it in the **Advanced Editor**.

`#{weatherApiLdap.WeatherByCityLdap.main.temp} > 10 and #{weatherApiLdap.WeatherByCityLdap.main.temp} <= 25` (Replace Ldap by your LDAP)

You'll then see this.

![Demo](./images/joc10.png)

In order to retrieve the temperature as part of this Condition, you need to provide the city in which the customer currently is.
The **City** needs to be linked to the dynamic parameter **q**, just like we saw previously in the Open Weather API Documentation.

Click the field **dynamic val: q** as indicated in the screenshot.

![Demo](./images/joc11.png)

You then need to find the field that contains the current city of the customer in one of the available Data Sources.

![Demo](./images/joc12.png)

You can find the field by navigating to ```geofenceEntryLdap.--aepTenantId--.locationService.currentPoiCity``` (Replace Ldap by your LDAP). By clicking that field, it will be added as the dynamic value for the parameter **q**. This field will be populated by for instance the geolocation-service that you've implemented in your Mobile App.

![Demo](./images/joc13.png)

Click **OK**.

![Demo](./images/jook.png)

Next, we'll add the 3rd condition.

## Condition 3: Warmer than 25° Celsius

After having added the second condition, you'll see this screen.

![Demo](./images/joct2.png)

Click **Add Path**.

![Demo](./images/joadd.png)

Click on the **Edit** icon for the expression of Path3.

![Demo](./images/joct6.png)

You'll then see an empty **Simple Editor** screen.

![Demo](./images/jo7.png)

Our query will be a bit more advanced, so we'll need the **Advanced Mode**.
Click **Advanced Mode**.

![Demo](./images/jo8.png)

You'll then see the **Advanced Editor** which allows code entry.

![Demo](./images/jo9.png)

Select the below code and paste it in the **Advanced Editor**.

`#{weatherApiLdap.WeatherByCityLdap.main.temp} > 25` (Replace Ldap by your LDAP)

You'll then see this.

![Demo](./images/joct10.png)

In order to retrieve the temperature as part of this Condition, you need to provide the city in which the customer currently is.
The **City** needs to be linked to the dynamic parameter **q**, just like we saw previously in the Open Weather API Documentation.

Click the field **dynamic val: q** as indicated in the screenshot.

![Demo](./images/joct11.png)

You then need to find the field that contains the current city of the customer in one of the available Data Sources.

![Demo](./images/joct12.png)

You can find the field by navigating to ```geofenceEntryLdap.--aepTenantId--.locationService.currentPoiCity```. By clicking that field, it will be added as the dynamic value for the parameter **q**. This field will be populated by for instance the geolocation-service that you've implemented in your Mobile App.

![Demo](./images/joct13.png)

Click **OK**.

![Demo](./images/jook.png)

You now have three configured paths.

![Demo](./images/jo3path.png)

As this is a journey for learning purpose, we'll now configure a couple of actions to showcase the variety of options marketeers now have to deliver messages.

## Path 1

For each of the temperature contexts, we'll attempt to send an SMS Message to our customer. We can only send an SMS if we have a Mobile Number available for a customer, so we'll first have to verify that we do.

Let's focus on **Path1**.

![Demo](./images/p1steps.png)

Let's take another **Condition** element and drag it as indicated in the screenshot above. We'll verify if for this customer, we have a mobile number available.

![Demo](./images/joa1.png)

Click on the **Edit** icon for the Expression for Path1.

![Demo](./images/joa2.png)

In the Data Sources, navigate to **ExperiencePlatform.ProfileFieldGroup.profile.mobilePhone.number**. You're now reading the mobile phone number directly from Adobe Experience Platform's Real-time Customer Profile.

![Demo](./images/joa3.png)

Select the field **Number**, then drag and drop it to the Condition Canvas.

Select the operator **is not empty**.

![Demo](./images/joa4.png)

`substr(#{ExperiencePlatform.ProfileFieldGroup.profile.mobilePhone.number}, 0, 12)`

FYI: This code is intended to work with mobile phone numbers that have 12 digits (including the +), like this one: +32463622044.
Several other countries have 13-digit phone numbers. If your mobile phone number has 13 digits (including the +), you need to update this code to:

`substr(#{ExperiencePlatformDataSource.ProfileFieldGroup.profile.mobilePhone.number}, 0, 13)`

![Demo](./images/joa16.png)

Click **OK**.

![Demo](./images/joa17.png)
