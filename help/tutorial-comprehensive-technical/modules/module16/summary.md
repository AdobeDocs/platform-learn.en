# Summary & benefits

Congratulations and thank you for investing your time in learning about Customer Journey Analytics and Adobe Experience Platform! 
In this module, you've learned how to ingest data from Google Cloud Platform, Google Analytics and Google BigQuery into Adobe Experience Platform to then analyze that data through Customer Journey Analytics. 

## Benefits

Let's highlight the benefits of using Customer Journey Analytics together with Adobe Experience Platform:

- With Customer Journey Analytics, you can now join data from any source in real-time. Analyzing the customer journey is now no longer limited to web and mobile applications so you can bring in data from non-Adobe environments like Google Cloud Platform and Google BigQuery.
- With Customer Journey Analytics, you can join the data flexibly when adding datasets from various sources into the same data view. This offers you, as an analyst, a lot of flexibility and options to look at data in different ways.
- Customer Journey Analytics doesn't require a separate implementation of data sources anymore. All data that resides in Adobe Experience Platform can be used out of the box. Your Google Analytics data that was ingested in Adobe Experience Platform can be used for visualization but also for activation through the Real-time CDP application service and for data science using Data Science Workspace.
- You can now benefit from using only one data collection implementation across all your online sources. With Web SDK and Adobe Experience Platform, data is ingested in an XDM format, which means that as an analyst you can focus on getting insights out of the data instead of having to implement your own tracking.
