# 3.4.1 Configure a trigger-based journey - Order Confirmation

Login to Adobe Journey Optimizer by going to [Adobe Experience Cloud](https://experience.adobe.com). Click **Journey Optimizer**.

![ACOP](./../../../modules/ajo-b2c/module3.1/images/acophome.png)

You'll be redirected to the **Home**  view in Journey Optimizer. First, make sure you're using the correct sandbox. The sandbox to use is called `--aepSandboxName--`. You'll then be in the **Home** view of your sandbox `--aepSandboxName--`.

![ACOP](./../../../modules/ajo-b2c/module3.1/images/acoptriglp.png)

## 3.4.1.1 Create your event

In the menu, go to **Configurations** and click **Manage** under **Events**.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc30.png)

On the **Events** screen, you'll see a view similar to this. Click **Create Event**.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc31.png)

You'll then see an empty event configuration.

First of all, give your Event a Name like this: `--aepUserLdap--PurchaseEvent`, and add a description like this: `Purchase Event`.

For **Type**, select **Unitary**.
For **Event ID Type**, select **System Generated**.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/eventidtype.png)

Next is the Schema selection. A schema was prepared for this exercise. Please use the schema `Demo System - Event Schema for Website (Global v1.1) v.1`.

After selecting the Schema, you'll see a number of fields being selected in the **Payload** section. Click the **Edit/Pencil** icon to add additional fields to this event.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc36.png)

You'll then see this popup. You now need to check additional checkboxes in order to access additional data when this event gets triggered.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc37.png)

First of all, check the checkbox on the line `--aepTenantId--`.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc38.png)

Next, scroll down and check the checkbox on the line `commerce`. 

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc391.png)

Next, scroll down and check the checkbox on the line `productListItems`. Click **Ok**.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc39.png)

You'll then see that additional fields have been added to the event. Click **Save**.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc40.png)

Your new event is then saved and you'll see your event in the list of available events now.

Click on your event again to open up the **Edit Event** screen again. 
Hover over the **Payload** field again to see the 3 icons again. Click on the **View Payload** icon. 

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc41.png)

You'll now see an example of the expected payload. Your event has a unique orchestration eventID, which you can find by scrolling down in that payload until you see `_experience.campaign.orchestration.eventID`.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc42.png)

The event ID is what needs to be sent to Adobe Journey Optimizer in order to trigger the journey that you'll build in the next step. Write down this eventID, as you'll need it in one of the next steps.
`"eventID": "1c8148a8ab1993537d0ba4e6ac293dd4f2a88d80b2ca7be6293c3b28d4ff5ae6"`

Click **Ok**, followed by **Cancel**.

Your event is now configured and ready to be used.

## 3.4.1.2 Create your journey

In the menu, go to **Journeys** and click **Create Journey**.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc43.png)

You'll then see this. Give your journey a name. Use `--aepUserLdap-- - Order Confirmation journey`. Click **Save**.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc45.png)

First, you need to add your event as the starting point of your journey. Search for your event `--aepUserLdap--PurchaseEvent` and drag and drop it onto the canvas. Click **Save**.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc46.png)

Next, under **Actions**, search for the **Email** action and add it onto the canvas.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc47.png)

Set the **Category** to **Marketing** and select an email surface that enables you to send email. In this case, the email surface to select is **Email**. Ensure that the checkboxes for **Clicks on email** and **email opens** are both enabled.

![ACOP](./images/journeyactions1.png)

The next step is to create your message. To do that, click **Edit content**.

![ACOP](./images/journeyactions2.png)

![ACOP](./images/journeyactions3.png)

In the text area start writing **Thanks for your order,** and click the **Personalization** icon.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc5.png)

The subject line is not done yet. Next you need to bring in the personalization token for the field **First name** which is stored under `profile.person.name.firstName`. In the left menu, scroll down to find the **Person** > **Full name** >  **First name** field and click on the **+** icon to add the personalization token into the subject line. Click **Save**.

In the left menu, go to **Fragments**. Drag the header you created earlier in [exercise 3.1.2.1](./../module3.1/ex2.md) onto the first component in the canvas. Drag the footer you created earlier in [exercise 3.1.2.2](./../module3.1/ex2.md) onto the last component in the canvas.

Click the **+** icon in the left menu. Go to **Contents** to start adding content onto the canvas.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc10.png)

Go to **Contents** and drag and drop an **Image** component on the second row. Click **Browse**.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc24.png)

There are 2 references of **xxx** in this HTML code. You now have to replace each **xxx** by a reference to the productListItems object that is part of the event that triggers the journey.
