# 3.2 Adobe Journey Optimizer: External data sources and custom actions

**Author: [Wouter Van Geluwe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/woutervangeluwe/)**

In this module, you'll use Adobe Journey Optimizer to listen to customer behavior, both online and offline, and respond to it in an intelligent, contextual and real-time way. You've already had an initial hands-on experience with Adobe Journey Optimizer in Module 6. In this exercise, you'll go a bit deeper and explore a more advanced use case whereby external data sources are used as part of a journey.

## Learning Objectives

- Learn how to create events, external data sources and journeys in Adobe Journey Optimizer
- Learn how to consume weather information from the Open Weather API
- Learn how to use custom action destinations like Twilio and Slack from Adobe Journey Optimizer

## Prerequisites

- Access to Adobe Experience Platform: [https://experience.adobe.com/platform](https://experience.adobe.com/platform)
- Access to Adobe Journey Optimizer
- Access to the Open Weather API

## Business Context

As a brand, you've invested heavily in personalizing online experiences. Now, you want to be as contextual and relevant for offline experiences.
In this module, you'll use a customer's presence in an offline store to then deliver a personalized experience inside the store by showcasing relevant content to that customer on our in-store screens and at the same time, we want to deliver a personalized Push or SMS Message to that same customer, all in real-time.
As a brand, you also understand that context greatly impacts a customer's interest, so you want to bring in the current weather information of that customer's location, to decide what content or promotion to display.
