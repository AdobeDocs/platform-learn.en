# Summary & benefits

Congratulations and thank you for investing your time in learning about Journey Orchestration and Adobe Experience Platform! 
In this module, you've learned how to configure an account creation journey by using Journey Orchestration which is triggered in real-time when the customer creates an account on the website. 

## Benefits

Let's highlight the benefits of defining journeys in Journey Orchestration in combination with Adobe Experience Platform:

- Communication with customers needs to be real-time and contextual. With Journey Orchestration, you now have the ability to listen for specific customer-initiated events and carefully curate a contextual journey if and when the customer is going through that specific journey.
- Orchestrating a journey can involve wait times, conditions whereby data in Adobe Experience Platform is verified to then send the journey into a different path and also, custom actions whereby any application with an API can receive instructions from Journey Orchestration on what content to show to which customer.
- Personalizing engagements can now truly happen across any channel that is used to interact with the customer.
