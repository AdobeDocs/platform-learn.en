# Summary & benefits

Congratulations and thank you for investing your time in learning about Microsoft Dynamics 365, Journey Orchestration and Adobe Experience Platform! 
In this module, you learnt how to set up your instance of Dynamics 365 for Sales and load sample customer data. You then used the Dynamics 365 Source Connector in Adobe Experience Platform to ingest that data from Microsoft Dynamics 365 into Adobe Experience Platform.

Finally, you used Journey orchestration to connect directly with Microsoft Dynamics 365 APIs to create a contract record from the AEP Demo website and you configured Journey orchestration to communicate directly to a customer based on the on a change in sentiment. In addition, you also learnt how to set up and configure Microsoft Power Automate (Flow) and trigger a custom action directly into Journey Orchestration based on the Contact record change in Microsoft Dynamics 365.
