# 2.4 Real-Time CDP: Segment Activation to Microsoft Azure Event Hub

**Authors: [Marc Meewis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcmeewis/), [Wouter Van Geluwe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/woutervangeluwe/)**

In this module, you'll setup a Microsoft Azure EventHub destination as a real-time destination for Adobe Experience Platform Real-time CDP. You will also setup and deploy an Azure function that will be triggered in real-time whenever Adobe Experience Platform delivers a segment payload to your Azure EventHub destination. The Azure Function that you'll trigger will show the mechanism of Adobe Experience Platform Real-time CDP's activation capabilities.

As part of this module you will also get an understanding of what triggers Real-time CDP to actually deliver a payload to a specified destination. We will also discuss the status of a segment qualification and how it relates to activation.

Adobe Experience Platform Real-time CDP supports data activation to streaming cloud storage destinations, allowing you to export audience data and events in real-time to these destinations in JSON format. You can then describe business logic on top of these events in your destinations

Microsoft Azure Event Hubs is a fully managed, real-time data ingestion service thatâ€™s simple, trusted, and scalable. Stream millions of events per second from any source to build dynamic data pipelines and immediately respond to business challenges.

## Learning Objectives

- Become familiar with the Microsoft Azure Event Hubs
- Setup an RTCDP destination to your Microsoft Azure Event Hub
- Understand when Real-time CDP activates and what the activation payload looks like
- Setup Visual Studio Code to develop, test and deploy your Azure project
- Create and deploy an Azure function that consumes segments qualifications delivered in real-time by RTCDP

## Prerequisites

- Access to [Adobe Experience Platform](https://experience.adobe.com/platform)
- Familiarity with the AEP Demo website environment
- Understand how to define, use and activate Streaming Segments in Adobe Experience Platform

## Exercises

[2.4.0 Configure your environment](./ex0.md)

In this exercise, you'll setup your Microsoft Azure environment.

[2.4.1 Configure your Microsoft Azure EventHub environment](./ex1.md)

In this exercise you'll setup your Microsoft Azure EventHub environment.

[2.4.2 Configure your Azure Event Hub Destination in Adobe Experience Platform](./ex2.md)

In this exercise you'll setup your Real-time CDP destination connection that will deliver segments in real-time to the EventHub that you've configured in the previous exercise.

[2.4.3 Create a segment](./ex3.md)

In this exercise you will create a streaming segment in Adobe Experience Platform

[2.4.4 Activate segment](./ex4.md)

In this exercise you'll activate your streaming segment to your Real-time CDP EventHub destination.

[2.4.5 Create your Microsoft Azure Project](./ex5.md)

In this exercise you will create an Azure function that will be triggered in real-time when Adobe Experience platform activates segment qualifications to the corresponding Azure Event Hub destination.

[2.4.6 End-to-end scenario](./ex6.md)

At this point, everything is setup. You can now do some browsing on your AEP Demo website and get segment qualifications delivered to your Microsoft Azure EventHub Trigger function.
