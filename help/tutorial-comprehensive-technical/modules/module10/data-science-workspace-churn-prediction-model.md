# 10. Data Science Workspace - Churn Prediction Model

**Author: [Tina Soni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tinadsoni/), [Wouter Van Geluwe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/woutervangeluwe/)**

In **Module 10** you'll learn how to create a  Machine Learning model that predicts a customer's likelihood to churn. 

## Learning Objectives

- Learn basic Data Science concepts and terminology
- Explore Adobe Experience Platform Data Science Workspace
- Analyze and transform your data.
- Author a model and operationalize it
- Train your model and experiment
- Build and Publish a Recipe.

## Prerequisites

- Access to Adobe Experience Platform: [https://experience.adobe.com/platform](https://experience.adobe.com/platform)
- Access to the zip file containing the three required notebooks
- This documentation has been created to facilitate hands-on, technical enablement around Adobe Experience Platform. In order to complete some of the modules, you'll need to change some variables and replace them by your specific **Environment Variables**. Please contact your Adobe contact who will provide you with the required **Environment Variables** of your specific Adobe Experience Platform instance.

>This tutorial was created to facilitate a particular workshop format. It uses specific systems and accounts to which you might not have access. Even without access, we think you can still learn a lot by reading through this very detailed content. If you're a participant in one of the workshops and need your access credentials, please contact your Adobe representative who will provide you with the required information.

## Exercises

[10.1 - Introduction to Data Science](./ex1.md)

Learn about basic concepts and terminology used in the data science world.

[10.2 Churn Prediction: Data Preparation](./ex2.md)

One of the first steps in any data science project is Data Preparation. A Data Scientist has to ensure data is correct before feeding it into a model.

[10.3 Feature Engineering and Model Building](./ex3.md)

In this exercise, a Data Scientist creates the Target variable and create some independent, explanatory variables to add as inputs to the model.

[10.4 Experimentation - Recipe Building](./ex4.md)

In this exercise, you'll convert the feature engineering and model that you have prepared in the above steps into a recipe.
