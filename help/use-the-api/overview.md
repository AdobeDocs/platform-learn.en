## About Adobe Experience Platform

Adobe Experience Platform is the most powerful, flexible, and ]open system on the market for building and managing complete solutions that drive customer experiences. Experience Platform enables organizations to centralize and standardize customer data and content from any system and apply data science and machine learning to dramatically improve the design and delivery of rich, personalized experiences.

Experience Platform was built API-first, exposing the full functionality of the system to developers and supporting the easy integration of enterprise solutions using familiar tools. Experience Platform also supports partners to build and integrate their own products and technologies as needed.

## About the Lessons

In these lessons, you will learn the Platform API from the perspective of Luma, a fictitious yoga-based lifestyle site and online store. Adobe Experience Platform allows Luma to build a basis for its customer experience and loyalty program on the Unified Profile Service.

Adobe Experience Platform enables Luma to understand its users via Unified Profile, by bringing in existing customer profiles through batch ingestion, creating profiles and adding real-time behavioral data through streaming ingestion, and managing those Unified Profiles using the segmentation engine. All of this data helps to hydrate the Unified Profile, giving Luma a full real-time view of their customers.

You will use your own Platform account and we will provide a Postman collection and other materials to get you started. Postman is a widely used tool for interacting with APIs and was chosen for this tutorial as a "common denominator" environment for learning the API. Once you are comfortable with the API, can then incorporate them as needed into your own custom environment.

## Pre-requisites
