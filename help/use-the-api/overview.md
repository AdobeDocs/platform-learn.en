## About Adobe Experience Platform

In these lessons, you will learn the Platform API from the perspective of Luma, a fictitious yoga-based lifestyle site and online store. Adobe Experience Platform allows Luma to build a basis for its customer experience and loyalty program on the Unified Profile Service.

Adobe Experience Platform enables Luma to understand its users via Unified Profile, by bringing in existing customer profiles through batch ingestion, creating profiles and adding real-time behavioral data through streaming ingestion, and managing those Unified Profiles using the segmentation engine. All of this data helps to hydrate the Unified Profile, giving Luma a full real-time view of their customers.
