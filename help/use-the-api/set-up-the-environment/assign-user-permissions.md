# Assign User Permissions

In this lesson you will assign yourself user- and developer-level access to your organization's Experience Platform account. If you already have this level of access, you can proceed to the next lesson.

## Prerequisites

In order to complete this lesson, your organization must be provisioned for Experience Platform and you must have an Adobe Id. Also, a System Administrato for your Adobe solutions will need to complete these steps. If you don't have System Administrator access, reach out to one of your organization's System Administrators and ask them to give you access following the steps below.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Assign user-level access to Platform so users can access the Platform User Interface
* Assign developer-level access to Platform so users can use the Platform API

## Unsure if you already have access?
