# Configure Streaming Events

## Events

An event is linked to an individual person. Journey Orchestration listens to events and orchestrates the best next actions within the customer's journey based on these events. An event can relate to:

* An individual's interaction (e.g., a customer bought a product, visited a store, or abandoned an online shopping cart)
* Or something happening that is connected to the individual (e.g., a customer reaches 10 000 loyalty points)

Journey Orchestration Events are XDM Experience Events that are sent to the Adobe Experience Platform via streaming ingestion.
