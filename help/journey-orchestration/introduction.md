# Understanding Journey Orchestration

## Introduction to Journey Orchestration

Journey Orchestration allows you to build real-time orchestration use cases leveraging contextual data stored in events or data sources.

Journey Orchestration is an application service integrated with the Experience Platform. It provides an intelligent and open ecosystem to activate all relevant live data through scalable, event-based engagement across any channel your business requires from marketing to operations to service. Journey Orchestration can leverage any data in Adobe Experience Platform and any external delivery system to create and deliver compelling experiences.

## How to Configure a Journey

The main steps in preparation for building journeys are:

1. [Configure Streaming Events](/help/journey-orchestration/configure-streaming-events.md) - This configuration is mandatory, as Journey Orchestration is designed to listen to events.
2. [Configure Data Sources](/help/journey-orchestration/configure-data-sources.md) - This configuration is not required if your journeys only leverage local data coming from an event payload.
3. [Configure Custom Actions](/help/journey-orchestration/configure-actions.md): Required if you want to use a service from any 3rd party provider that can be called through a REST API with a JSON formatted payload


>[!NOTE]
>
>These configuration steps require technical knowledge. You will need to be familiar with the [Experience Data Model (XDM)](/help/schemas/understanding-the-xdm-system-and-experience-data-model.md) and [how to compose XDM Experience EventSchemas](/help/schemas/create-your-first-schema-with-out-of-the-box-components.md).
