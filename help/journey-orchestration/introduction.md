## How to Configure a Journey

The main steps in preparation for building journeys are:

1. [Configure Streaming Events](/help/journey-orchestration/configuring-streaming-events.md) - This configuration is mandatory, as Triggered Journeys is designed to listen to events.
2. [Configure Data Sources](/help/journey-orchestration/configuring-data-sources.md) - This configuration is not required if your journeys only leverage local data coming from an event payload.
3. [Configure Custom Actions](/help/journey-orchestration/configuring-actions.md): Required if you want to us a service from any 3rd party provider that can be called through a REST API with a Jason formatted payload

>[!NOTE]
>These configuration steps require technical knowledge. You will need to be familiar with the [Experience Data Model (XDM)](/help/schemas/understanding-the-xdm-system-and-experience-data-model.md) and [how to compose XDM Experience EventSchemas](/help/schemas/create-your-first-schema-with-out-of-the-box-components.md).
