# Configure Streaming Events

An event is linked to a person. It relates to the behavior of a person (for example, a person bought a
product, visited a shop, exited a website, etc.) or something happening linked to a person (for example,
a person reached 10 000 loyalty points). This is what Triggered Journeys will listen to in journeys to
orchestrate the best next actions.

The event configuration allows you to define the information Triggered Journeys will receive as events.
You can use several events (in different steps of a journey) and several journeys can use the same event.

The video below explains how to configure a streaming evens for Journey Orchestration.

>[!NOTE]
>This configuration is mandatory, as Triggered Journeys is designed to listen to events, and always
performed by a technical user
