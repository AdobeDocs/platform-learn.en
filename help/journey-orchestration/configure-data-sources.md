# Configure Data Sources

Journey Orchestration allows you to connect to the Adobe Experience Platform or other third-party data sources to retrieve additional information that can be used in a journey for:

* Definition of conditions
* Parameters and personalization data in actions
* Custom timer definition
* Custom timezone definition

This configuration is not required if your journeys only leverage local data coming from an event payload.

The following video explains how to: Configure an Experience Platform Data Source and an external data source, as well as how to find and use data in a journey.
