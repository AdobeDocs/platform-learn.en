# Configuring Data Sources

Journey Orchestration allows you to connect to the Adobe Experience Platform or other third-party data sources to retrieve additional information that can be used in a journey for:

* Definition of conditions
* Parameters and personalization data in actions
* custom timer definition
* custom timezone definition

This configuration is not required if your journeys only leverage local data coming from an event payload.

The following video explains how to configure Experience Platform Data Source, configure an external data source, find and use data in a journey.
