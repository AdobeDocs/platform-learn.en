# Introduction to Journey Orchestration

Journey Orchestration allow real-time orchestration powered by contextual data from events, information from the Adobe Experience Platform, or data from third-party solutions.
The feature determines in multistep flows called journeys the next best actions specific to the consumer, based on their profile and behaviors. This comprises both the optimal timing, as well as the type action, such as sending the consumer an update via push notification or the notification of a third party system. These decisions are made based on rules and Sensei scores.

Journey orchestration leverages data stored on the Experience Platform, data stored in any third party service that can be queried through an API call, and contextual information shared through the payload of the event triggering the journeys.
