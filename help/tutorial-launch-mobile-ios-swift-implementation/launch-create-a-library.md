# Add a Library

In this lesson, you will create a library for your new Launch property. A library packages together all of the desired Launch settings and generates  the specific implementation instructions required to install the library in your mobile app.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Create a library
* Add changes to a library
* Build a library

## Save Your Changes to a Library

After configuring your extensions, you need to package them into a library that you can deploy in your app so you can use your solutions.

**To add and build a library**

1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Publishing]** tab
