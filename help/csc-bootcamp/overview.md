# Experience Makers Content Supply Chain Bootcamp

## Overview

The world is now digital first. It's a reality that businesses have been forced to come to terms with, and it's not going away anytime soon. As part of this digital world, we're facing a huge surge of content propelled by more people browsing social media, spending time in digital spaces, and working remotely. 

What this means for you is that there are more channels, markets, and formats to deliver content — and there's a greater need for that content to be dynamic and optimized. 

This bootcamp learns you how to keep up with the demand for content: there's a way to plan, produce, and deliver content more quickly and easily. It's called a content supply chain. And if you can get one up and running with smooth processes, strong strategy, and solid practices, you can streamline the entire content lifecycle.
