# Insights: Overview

Let's have a look at a number of reports that will give you good insights on your Campaigns.  These are only examples.  There are many others available out of the box and building or modifying a report is something rather easy for you.  

The one thing you need to remember is that any field existing on the platform (either natively or created by you, i.e. custom fields) can be part of a reporting.  So the choices are virtually limitless.
