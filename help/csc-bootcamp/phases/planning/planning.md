# Planning

>[!NOTE]
>
> During the Bootcamp, you will wear several hats: Requestor, Project manager, Designer and Upper Management. This will give you a glance of each profile's user experience.

Let's now have a look at the Work Management Platform, Adobe Workfront. Workfront makes your goals visible to the entire organisation so everyone can strategically prioritise work, track progress and measure results. And as your goals evolve, Workfront cascades information to teams executing work on the ground. The result? Greater alignment, focus and speed reaching success.

Log on to your Workfront profile by browsing to [adobebootcampemea-02032301.testdrive.workfront.com](https://adobebootcampemea-02032301.testdrive.workfront.com) and logging in with the credentials the Adobe team provided to you.

You will be faced with this login page.  Sign in with your professional e-mail address you subscribed with to the bootcamp as username:

![The Adobe Login Page](./images/adobe-login.png)

After successful login, you will be faced with this homepage:

![Workfront homepage](./images/wf-homepage.png)

## Preparing Workfront for usage

We will now prepare our home page as if we were using Workfront on a regular basis.  That means that we are going to go and get relevant pages for our workflow of later and 'PIN' them on top of our home-page.

First of all, let's go and get our TEAM's workload page.  Click on the waffle on the top right and select 'Teams'

![The Teams menu](./images/wf-teams.png)

Once our TEAM (Marketing – Digital) is on the screen, simply 'PIN' it to your top ribbon: 

![Pin page](./images/wf-pin.png)

Your top ribbon should now look like this:

![top ribbon](./images/wf-top-ribbon.png)

Let's now pin a project that we are going to analyse more closely later on.  Click on the Projects PINNED page and click on the search button.  Type 'Mobile app awareness campaign' and click on the project name:

![mobile app awareness](./images/wf-app-awareness.png)

Once the project is on your screen, PIN it to your top ribbon like we did before:

![pin page again](./images/wf-pin-2.png)

Your top ribbon should now look like this:

![updated top ribbon](./images/wf-ribbon-2.png)

Finally, click on the top right waffle once again and select PORTFOLIOS.

![portfolios](./images/wf-portfolios.png)

Click on the search button and type 'TRANSFORM'.  Click on the 'Transform The Customer Experience' Portfolio to open it:

![transform customer experience](./images/wf-transform-cx.png)

Once the Portfolio is open, PIN it to your top ribbon:

![pin portfolio](./images/wf-portfolio-pin.png)

Your top ribbon should now look like this:

![final top ribbon](./images/wf-final-top-ribbon.png)

We are now ready to start our workflow with an interface that shows us exactly what we need on a regular basis.

## Requestor 

We will now start the actual work intake with the Requestor's hat. A Requestor, for example a Product Manager, we would like to formalize a request for our new Adobike Campaign and provide the information of the Marketing Brief.

- On the top left, click on Requests:

![Workfront requests](./images/wf-homepage-requests.png)

- Then, click on 'New request':

![New request](./images/wf-new-request.png)

- As the request type, select "Marketing Requests", then "CSB – Campaign Requests":

![CSB Request](./images/wf-csb-request.png)

- Enter the subject: "Adobike Campaign - \*team\*" (fill in your team number). You are free to add a description and a priority.

![Request details](./images//wf-request-details.png)

- Everything below the "CSB – Marketing Campaign Brief" header is fully customisable. In this case, these are all custom fields that you can adapt to your own Marketing brief needs. Here are the Brief fields that we have created for this Bootcamp:

![Custom fields in Workfront](./images//wf-custom-fields.png)

-   Let's start filling in the Brief:

    - Set the start date to 01/06/2023 – Set the end date to 30/06/2023:

    ![Set start and end date](./images/wf-start-end-date.png)

    - Select AEM Assets, as we will have some assets available to be used in this campaign there:

    ![Existing content in AEM Assets](./images/wf-aem-assets.png)

    - On 'New content', note that if you click yes, an extra (conditional) field appears with a time-line warning:

    ![New content shows warning](./images/wf-new-content.png)

    - Since we're on a tight deadline, let's change our choice to "NO":

    ![No new content](./images/wf-no-new-content.png)

    - On the channels, we made the choice of pre-selecting some by default. And those are the ones we will need for the next step, so no change needed here:

    ![Channels](./images/wf-channels.png)

    - Adobe Commerce, select yes:

    ![Select Commerce](./images/wf-commerce.png)

-   Finally, in the documents section, you can add any relevant documentation for your request.  Here, we are going to make use of the AEM connector to show you how you can get existing content from our AEM Assets instance.

    - Click on 'Add or link files' and select Link from 'experience-manager'.

    ![add links](./images/wf-add-links.png)

    - You are now faced with the AEM Assets Folders and you can browse through them (and/or use the search engine) to get the documents/assets that you need for your request:

    ![select folders](./images/wf-linked-folders.png)

    - Feel free to attach any items from AEM Assets that you feel could be relevant to this project, if any. When you're done, either click "Link" to link to assets, or 'Close' if you're not linking any folders.

    ![close](./images/wf-close.png)

-   We've now completed our request and are ready to submit it:

![submit request](./images/wf-submit-request.png)


## Project Manager

Now that we have submitted our request as 'Requestor' (e.g. Product Manager) we are going to change hats and wear the one of Project Manager.

- Click on the 'Adobe' Logo and you will land on the 'New Marketing Requests' page (this is a typical 'Project Manager' home page):

![Click the Adobe logo](./images/wf-click-adobe-logo.png)

- Under the 'Marketing – New Campaign Requests' section, you can find your newly created request:

![Newly created request](./images/wf-newly-created-request.png)

- Click on the request name:

![Request name](./images/wf-request-name.png)

- Click on 'Request Details':

![Request details](./images/wf-request-details2.png)

- Scroll down to the 'CSB – Marketing Campaign Brief' section and expand it:

![Expanded CSB section](./images/wf-csb-expand.png)

-   You can see all the details of the Requestor's brief and with this information, you can start a project plan based on a template.
    - On the top, next to your Request name, click on the three dots:

    ![Click the three dots](./images/wf-request-threedots.png)

    - Click on 'Convert to project from template':

    ![Convert to project](./images/wf-convert-to-project.png)

    - Select 'CSB – Marketing Campaign, then click on 'Use template':

    ![Use template](./images/wf-use-template.png)

    - Click on 'Convert to project' at the bottom of the page:

    ![Convert to project](./images/wf-convert-to-project.png)

-   We now have our Campaign project workflow based on the template. Let's PIN our project for later. Click on 'Pin current page':

![Pin page](./images/wf-pin-page.png)

- Some areas of attention:

![Areas of attention](./images/wf-areas-of-attention.png)

1.  Notion of Duration – It is the window of opportunity to complete a task.  
Notion of Planned Hours – it is the actual time needed to complete a task.

1.  Notion of Predecessors (aka dependencies) – those are the constraints tasks can have between one other (typically, this task cannot be started before this other one is completed). Which enables us to have a clear Gant Chart with the critical path for each project. Click on the below icon to view the Gant Chart:
![Gant Chart](./images/wf-gant-chart.png)

1.  Notion of Assignments – at the time the project is created, assignments are still generalistic as they come from a template. They are made to either Job Roles – represented by the hammer icon (i.e. a group of people who have the skills to complete this particular task) or to Teams – represented by the people icon (i.e. a defined by your company group of people). Now it is the moment to assign those tasks to individuals.

-   Today, we are going to concentrate on Teams pre-assignments and how to assign these to individuals.

-   As you can see, task 11 "Produce Social Media Ad" is assigned to the 'Marketing – Digital' Team:
![assignment of the task](./images/wf-social-media.png)

-   Let's see how this reflects on this team's planning by opening it's Resource Management page. Click on the 'Marketing – Digital' PIN on the top of the page:
![marketing digital pin](./images/wf-marketing-digital.png)

-   You now have this Teams planning view:

![teams planning view](./images/wf-teams-planning-view.png)

1.  The top part covers the Unassigned work for that particular team. It lists the projects the Team has assignment(s) in and by clicking on the arrow here, you have the visibility of the exact tasks that need to be covered by project:
![unassigned work](./images/wf-unassigned.png)

1.  The bottom part covers the Assigned work for the individuals in the team, but not only: it indeed shows the actual workload of each member of the team but also their schedule (e.g. Mon-Fri or Mon-Sat), their holidays, etc.
![assigned work](./images/wf-assigned.png)

-   To assign a task to an individual, just drag the task from the top part to one individual's line in the bottom part - See how Bea's workload has been adjusted and the details of her tasks assignments have been added:
