Go to [https://tagmanager.google.com/](https://tagmanager.google.com/) and login with your personal login details.

In the GTM UI, in the menu option **Workspace** - **Tags**, you should now see 4 tags. You now need to publish them.

Your GTM Property is now published. The last thing to do now is to setup the GTM Tags on the AEP Demo-website so that the GTM configuration is being loaded.
