**Authors: [Rob In der Maur](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ridmaur/), [Wouter Van Geluwe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/woutervangeluwe/)**

In **Module 4**, we will take you through the steps to demonstrate how an Internet of Things device, like an Amazon Alexa device, can send its relevant interactions to Adobe Experience Platform.

**Note:** Don't worry; if you're not familiar with configuring, setting up and/or using an Amazon Alexa device. We will guide you through all the necessary steps:

* How to set up your Amazon environment
* How to define and configure your Alexa skill, consisting of:
  * Creation
  * Invocation
  * Interaction Model
  * Interfaces
  * Endpoint
  * Display
* How to demonstrate your Alexa skill:
  * Using the simulator. See [here](https://robindermauracs.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/videos/DemoAlexaSkillSimulator.mp4) for an example.
  * Using a real Alexa device. See [here](https://robindermauracs.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/videos/DemoAlexaSkillRealDevice.mp4) for an example.

## Your Environment Variables

This documentation has been created to be reused across multiple Adobe Experience Platform instances for enablement purposes.
In order to complete some of the modules, you'll need to change some variables and replace them by your specific ``Environment Variables``.

You can view these variables [here](../../environment.md).
