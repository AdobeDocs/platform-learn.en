## Lab Overview

This module was presented by Tina Dilip Soni during a webinar/training session in EMEA on Nov. 20, 2019.

You can view the recording of that webinar [here](https://bluejeans.com/playback/s/80gVAzgKeGkkBQlDzHzTXuo0mEPqIlPuSttpvG1jMYslb4OP1Key7QnkBRBMzNqO).

You can also find Tina's slides [here](./resources/DataScienceWorkspaceSession.pdf).

## Key Takeaways

* Learn basic Data Science concepts and terminology
* Explore Adobe Experience Platform Data Science Workspace
* Analyze and transform your data.
* Author a model and operationalize it
* Train your model and experiment
* Build and Publish a Recipe.

## Prerequisites

* Access Adobe Experience Platform Data Science Workspace
* Datasets
* Zip-file containing the 3 required notebooks

## Your Environment Variables

This documentation has been created to be reused across multiple Adobe Experience Platform instances for enablement purposes.
In order to complete some of the modules, you'll need to change some variables and replace them by your specific ``Environment Variables``.

You can view these variables [here](../../environment.md).

## Content

### [Exercise 1 - Introduction to Data Science](./ex1.md)

Learn about basic concepts and terminology used in the Data Science world.

### [Exercise 2 - Churn Prediction: Data Preparation](./ex2.md)

One of the first steps in any Data Science project is Data Preparation. A Data Scientist has to ensure data is correct before feeding it into a model.

### [Exercise 3 - Feature Engineering and Model Building](./ex3.md)

In this exercise, a Data Scientist creates the Target variable and create some independent, explanatory variables to add as inputs to the model.

### [Exercise 4 - Experimentation - Recipe Building](./ex4.md)

In this exercise, you'll convert the feature engineering and model that you have prepared in the above steps into a recipe.
