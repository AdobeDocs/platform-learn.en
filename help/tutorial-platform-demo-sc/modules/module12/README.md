## Lab Overview

In this module you'll use Journey Orchestration to listen to customer behavior, both online and offline, and respond to it in an intelligent, contextual and real-time way.

## Use Case

As a brand, we've invested heavily in personalizing online experiences. Now, we want to be as contextual and relevant for offline experiences.
In this lab, we want to understand a customer's presence in an offline store to then deliver a personalized experience inside the store by showcasing relevant content to that customer on our in-store screens and at the same time, we want to deliver a personalized Push or SMS Message to that same customer, all in real-time.
As a brand, we also understand that context greatly impacts a customer's interest, so we want to bring in the current weather information of that customer's location, to decide what content or promotion to display.
