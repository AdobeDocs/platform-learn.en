- Access to Journey Orchestration
- Access to the Open Weather API
- Access to Twilio
- This documentation has been created to facilitate hands-on, technical enablement around Adobe Experience Platform.

Please contact your Adobe contact who will provide you with the required **Environment Variables** of your specific Adobe Experience Platform instance.

>If you don't have access to your own Adobe Experience Platform instance, don't let it stop you! You'll still learn a lot by reading through these very detailed tutorials.

## Business Context

As a brand, you've invested heavily in personalizing online experiences. Now, you want to be as contextual and relevant for offline experiences.
In this module, you'll use a customer's presence in an offline store to then deliver a personalized experience inside the store by showcasing relevant content to that customer on our in-store screens and at the same time, we want to deliver a personalized Push or SMS Message to that same customer, all in real-time.
As a brand, you also understand that context greatly impacts a customer's interest, so you want to bring in the current weather information of that customer's location, to decide what content or promotion to display.
