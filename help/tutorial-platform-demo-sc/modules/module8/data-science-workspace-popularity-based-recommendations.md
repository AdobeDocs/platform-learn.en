# 8. Data Science Workspace - Popularity Based Recommendations

**Authors: [Jonathan Lancar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanlancar/), [Wouter Van Geluwe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/woutervangeluwe/)**

In **Module 8** you'll learn how to create a simple Machine Learning model that generates product recommendations using Data Science Workspace for retailers like Luma Retail that want to deliver personalized recommendations. When customers visit the website and click on a product, they should be presented with personalized product recommendations afterwards.

## Learning Objectives

- Become familiar with the Adobe Experience Platform UI
- Explore Adobe Experience Platform Data Science Workspace
- Analyze and transform your data.
- Author a model and operationalize it
- Train your model and experiment
- Score your model and consume the insights

## Resources

- Access to Adobe Experience Platform: [https://platform.adobe.com](https://platform.adobe.com)
- Access to the zip-file containing the 3 required notebooks

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Your Adobe Experience Platform instance
>
>This documentation has been created to facilitate hands-on, technical enablement around Adobe Experience Platform. In order to execute these tutorials in a hands-on way, you will need access to an Adobe Experience Platform instance.
>
>In order to complete some of the modules, you'll need to change some variables and replace them by your specific **Environment Variables**. 
>
>Please contact your Adobe contact who will provide you with the required **Environment Variables** of your specific Adobe Experience Platform instance.
>
>If you don't have access to your own Adobe Experience Platform instance, don't let it stop you! You'll still learn a lot by reading through these very detailed tutorials.

## Exercises

### 8.1 Data Exploration and Transformation

To create a machine learning model that will recommend products that users might like when they are looking at a particular product, you need to analyze previous purchases made by users on the website. In this lesson, you'll explore purchase data flowing via Launch and WebSDK to Adobe Experience Platform and transform that data into a feature dataset that will be used to train your machine learning model.

Go to [8.1 Data Exploration and Transformation](./ex1.md)

### 8.2 Model Authoring and Operationalization

In 1 you created the training data required to power your Machine Learning model. In this lesson you'll learn how you can use this data and author a machine learning model. In the real world, creating a dataset and a machine learning model will be an iterative process.

Go to [8.2 Model Authoring and Operationalization](./ex2.md)

### 8.3 Model Training and Experimentation

So you’ve prepared your data, authored your model and packaged it to test it at scale as a recipe. Now let’s go ahead and train and test the model at scale.

Go to [8.3 Model Training and Experimentation](./ex3.md)

### 8.4 Scoring and Consumption of Insights

Now that you've experimented with your recommendations model and have determined the optimal run, you can move on to scoring the model to generate product recommendations for customers.

Go to [8.4 Scoring and Consumption of Insights](./ex4.md)
