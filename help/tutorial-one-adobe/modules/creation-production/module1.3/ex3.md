# 1.3.3 Campaign Activation to Meta

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>In order to complete this exercise, you need to have access to a working AEM Assets CS Author environment with AEM Content Hub enabled. If you follow exercise [Adobe Experience Manager Cloud Service & Edge Delivery Services](./../../../modules/asset-mgmt/module2.1/aemcs.md){target="_blank"} you wil have access to such an environment.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>If you have previously configured an AEM Assets CS Program with an Author and AEM Assets environment, it may be that your AEM CS sandbox was hibernated. Given that dehibernating such a sandbox takes 10-15 minutes, it would be a good idea to start the dehibernation process now so that you don't have to wait for it at a later time.
