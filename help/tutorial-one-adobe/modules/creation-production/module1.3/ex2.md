## 1.3.2.3 Templates

GenStudio for Performance Marketing enables content creators to produce consistent on-brand marketing content quickly using templates. A template significantly reduces the time and effort required to generate new content by providing a starting point that includes pre-configured layouts and design elements.

While GenStudio for Performance Marketing does not support the direct creation of templates within the application, you can easily design and prepare templates using popular design tools, such as Adobe InDesign, Illustrator, or Express. Once your design is complete, you can adapt it for use in GenStudio for Performance Marketing. In this exercise, you'll import a number of predefined templates into GenStudio for Performance Marketing.

In the previous exercise, you downloaded the file [CitiSignal-GSPeM-assets.zip](../../../assets/gspem/CitiSignal-GSPeM-assets.zip) to your desktop and unzipped it. That folder contains 4 sample templates that you now need to import in GenStudio.
