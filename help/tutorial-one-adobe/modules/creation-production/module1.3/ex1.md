# 1.3.1 Configuration: Brand

A brand distinguishes an organization, product, service or concept from others. Some aspects of a brand are objective, like a logo, while others are subjective, like tone of voice.

GenStudio for Performance Marketing uses the wealth of brand information from your brand, partners it with product and persona information, and builds out a comprehensive brand identity. This brand identity is used to inform the creation of on-brand content using Adobe’s generative AI technology.

To start creating your own brand, follow the below steps.

Go to [https://experience.adobe.com/](https://experience.adobe.com/){target="_blank"}. Open **GenStudio**.
