# 1.3 GenStudio for Performance Marketing

Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing offers a comprehensive suite of tools designed to streamline content creation, management, and analysis. It infuses the content creation lifecycle with generative AI capabilities that transform how marketing content is created, reviewed, shared, and analyzed.

GenStudio for Performance Marketing uses information about your brand and markets to enhance brand-compliant content creation. The generative AI leverages descriptions of customer personas, products, and brand guidelines to guide content generation in alignment with your organization’s requirements.

To effectively use the generative AI features to create and review campaign assets, a number of steps need to be performed:

- Setup guidelines: Brand guidelines capture brand characteristics such as products, personas and brand details. GenStudio for Performance Marketing’s underlying generative AI capabilities use these guidelines to establish guardrails that guide content generation. You can either upload Brands guideline documents or manually enter brand information.
- Upload templates: Templates accelerate content creation. A template contains approved features, such as headers and footers, and is optimized for specific channels. System managers typically upload and manage templates for their organization. Content editors use templates to jump-start the content creation process within the established boundaries of the organizational brand.
- Upload approved assets: Approved assets in Content are available to all GenStudio for Performance Marketing editors. You can populate Content with assets for content editors to use in creating new experiences or assets.
- Connect to a paid media account: Configure a connection between GenStudio for Performance Marketing and your paid media accounts to receive data from active marketing campaigns, assets, and experiences. Use Insights to analyze channel-derived data.

In this module, you'll learn how to perform all of the above steps yourself, and you'll finish the module by publishing your ad to a paid media destination.
