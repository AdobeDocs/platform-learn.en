>[!NOTE]

In case you're not logged in to the right environment, click the logo in the bottom left corner and click to select the environment that you need to use.

## 1.5.1.1 Create your workspace and project

Click **+ New Workspace**.

![Frame.io](./images/frameio3.png)

For the workspace name, use: `--aepUserLdap--`. Click **Save**.

![Frame.io](./images/frameio4.png)

Your workspace is now created. Next, you should create a new project. Click **+ New Project**.

![Frame.io](./images/frameio5.png)

Select **Blank** and use the name `CitiSignal`. Click **Create New Project**.

![Frame.io](./images/frameio6.png)

Your project is now created. You now need to upload assets in your project. Click **Upload**.

![Frame.io](./images/frameio7.png)

Download these files: [https://tech-insiders.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Frame.io_Assets.zip](https://tech-insiders.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Frame.io_Assets.zip) to your desktop and unzip them onto your desktop.

![Frame.io](./images/frameio8.png)

Select all the files and click **Open**.

>[!NOTE]
>
>As you can see in the screenshot, the folder **Sound Effects** isn't selected at this moment. This because the manual upload doesn't support uploading folders. In a couple of minutes you'll install the Frame.io Transfer app, which you will use to upload that folder and its files.

![Frame.io](./images/frameio9.png)

After a couple of minutes you'll see your files become available in Frame.io.

![Frame.io](./images/frameio10.png)

You've now uploaded files manually, but there's a better and faster way to upload and download files to and from Frame.io. The best way to do that is to use the Frame.io Transfer app.

## 1.5.1.2 Download and configure the Frame.io transfer app

Go to [https://frame.io/transfer](https://frame.io/transfer) and download the version for your computer.

![Frame.io](./images/frameio11.png)

Install the application and then open it.

![Frame.io](./images/frameio12.png)

When the application opens, it requires you to log in. Click **log in**.

![Frame.io](./images/frameio13.png)

Enter the email address of your Adobe account and click **Let's go**.

![Frame.io](./images/frameio14.png)

After successful authentication, click **Open Frame.io Transfer app**.

![Frame.io](./images/frameio15.png)

You should then see this. To select the correct environment, click to open the dropdown list.

![Frame.io](./images/frameio16.png)

Select the environment you need to use for this tutorial, which is `--aepImsOrgName--`.

![Frame.io](./images/frameio17.png)

You should then see the workspace and project that you created before, along with the files that you manually uploaded.

Click **Upload**.

![Frame.io](./images/frameio18.png)

Go to the folder that you used before, which contains the unzipped files that you downloaded earlier. Select the folder **Sound Effects** and click **Upload**.

![Frame.io](./images/frameio19.png)

Your files will then be uploaded.

![Frame.io](./images/frameio20.png)

Once uploaded, you'll see the new folder become available in Frame.io.

## 1.5.1.3 Set up Adobe Premiere Pro Beta

You already installed Adobe Premiere Pro Beta as part of the Getting Started module. To use Frame.io in combination with Adobe Premiere Pro Beta, you can make us of the plugin that was developed for this integration.

Open the Creative Cloud app and search for `frame.io`.

![Frame.io](./images/frameio23.png)

Scroll down in the search results to find the plugin **Frame.io V4 Comments**. Click it.

![Frame.io](./images/frameio24.png)

You should then see this. Click **Install**.

![Frame.io](./images/frameio25.png)

If Adobe Premiere Pro Beta is open, you'll need to **Close** it first before you can install the plugin.

![Frame.io](./images/frameio26.png)

Click **OK**. The plugin is now being installed.

![Frame.io](./images/frameio27.png)

Once the plugin is installed, open Adobe Premiere Pro Beta on your computer.
