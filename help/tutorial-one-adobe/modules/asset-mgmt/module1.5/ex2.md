# 1.5.2 Connect ACCS to AEM Sites CS/EDS Storefront

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>In order to complete this exercise, you need to have access to a working AEM Sites and Assets CS with EDS environment. 
>
>If you don't have such an environment yet, go to exercise [Adobe Experience Manager Cloud Service & Edge Delivery Services](./../../../modules/asset-mgmt/module2.1/aemcs.md){target="_blank"}. Follow the instructions there, and you'll have access to such an environment.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>If you have previously configured an AEM CS Program with an AEM Sites and Assets CS environment, it may be that your AEM CS sandbox was hibernated. Given that dehibernating such a sandbox takes 10-15 minutes, it would be a good idea to start the dehibernation process now so that you don't have to wait for it at a later time.
