# 2.4 Real-Time CDP: Audience Activation to Microsoft Azure Event Hub

In this module, you'll setup a Microsoft Azure EventHub destination as a real-time destination for Adobe Experience Platform Real-time CDP. You will also setup and deploy an Azure function that will be triggered in real-time whenever Adobe Experience Platform delivers an audience payload to your Azure EventHub destination. The Azure Function that you'll trigger will show the mechanism of Adobe Experience Platform Real-time CDP's activation capabilities.

As part of this module you will also get an understanding of what triggers Real-time CDP to actually deliver a payload to a specified destination. We will also discuss the status of an audience qualification and how it relates to activation.

Adobe Experience Platform Real-time CDP supports data activation to streaming cloud storage destinations, allowing you to export audience data and events in real-time to these destinations in JSON format. You can then describe business logic on top of these events in your destinations

Microsoft Azure Event Hubs is a fully managed, real-time data ingestion service thatâ€™s simple, trusted, and scalable. Stream millions of events per second from any source to build dynamic data pipelines and immediately respond to business challenges.
