# Summary & benefits

Congratulations and thank you for investing your time in learning about Real-time CDP and Adobe Experience Platform! 
In this module, you've learned how to configure an audience and activate it for streaming qualification and how to take action and send that audience to Google DV360, Google AdWords, Amazon S3 and Adobe Target. 

## Benefits

Let's highlight the benefits of taking action with Adobe Experience Platform:

- Every audience that is built in Adobe Experience Platform is automatically available to applications like Adobe Target through Adobe Experience Cloud's People Core Service and Audience Library. With that, you build your audience once and reuse it across all the Adobe ecosystem
- Audiences can be sent to a number of out-of-the-box destinations that are available as part of the Real-time CDP application service. These destinations include DSPs like Google DV360, The Trade Desk, ESPs like Adobe Campaign, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Oracle Eloqua and Oracle Responsys and other destinations like Amazon S3 and more.
