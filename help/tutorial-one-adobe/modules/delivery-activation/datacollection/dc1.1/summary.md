# Summary & benefits

Congratulations and thank you for investing your time in learning about Adobe Experience Platform! 
In this module, you've learned how to configure Web SDK to collect data from the demo website in XDM format just once, to then reuse that data by sharing it with multiple applications like Adobe Audience Manager and Adobe Experience Platform. 

## Benefits

Let's highlight the benefits of using Web SDK to ingest data into Adobe Experience Platform:

- Web SDK replaces all application-specific legacy JavaScript and as such, simplifies your implementation a lot.
- Data collection now happens in XDM format immediately, which again simplifies your implementation.
