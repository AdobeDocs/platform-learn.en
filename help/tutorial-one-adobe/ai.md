**Goal** 

Build your own agent. 

Learners will build their own agent that uses a LLM to analyze requests. The analysis of the request will then be used to build a plan that contains instructions, which well then be executed one-by-one. To make this possible, the agent needs to understand what skills are available. Learners will build a number of skills themselves, skills which will each be built using a MCP server and that will consume Adobe product API's such as Adobe Firefly Services, Workfront Fusion and others.
