## Overview - Work In Progress

Agentic AI Tech Labs are a work in progress and will be released in November/December 2025.

1. Getting Started with Agents and AI

**Goal** 

Build your own agent. 

Learners will build their own agent that uses a LLM to analyze requests. The analysis of the request will then be used to build a plan that contains instructions, which well then be executed one-by-one. To make this possible, the agent needs to understand what skills are available. Learners will build a number of skills themselves, skills which will each be built using a MCP server and that will consume Adobe product API's such as Adobe Firefly Services, Workfront Fusion and others.

- Image GenAI
- Text GenAI

What's the architecture behind an agent?

Technical elements:

2. Agent Collaboration

**Goal**

Connect your own agent to Adobe agents. Learners will set up the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol to connect their agents with AEP Agent Orchestrator. 

- Agent Chaining
- Agent Collaboration
