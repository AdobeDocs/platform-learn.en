# 10.4 Setup and use push notifications for iOS

In order to use push notifications with Adobe Journey Optimizer, there are a number of settings to check and know about.

Here are all the settings to verify:

- Datasets and schemas in Adobe Experience Platform
- Datastream for mobile
- Data collection property for mobile
- App surface for push certificates
- Test your push setup using AEP Assurance

Let's review these one by one.

Login to Adobe Journey Optimizer by going to [Adobe Experience Cloud](https://experience.adobe.com). Click **Journey Optimizer**.

![ACOP](../module7/images/acophome.png)

You'll be redirected to the **Home**  view in Journey Optimizer. First, make sure you're using the correct sandbox. The sandbox to use is called `--aepSandboxId--`. To change from one sandbox to another, click on **PRODUCTION Prod (VA7)** and select the sandbox from the list. In this example, the sandbox is named **AEP Enablement FY22**. You'll then be in the **Home** view of your sandbox `--aepSandboxId--`.

## 10.4.1 Push datasets

Adobe Journey Optimizer uses datasets to store things like the push tokens from mobile devices or interactions with push messages (such as: message sent, message opened, etc) in a dataset in Adobe Journey Optimizer.

You can find these datasets by going to **[!UICONTROL Datasets]** in the menu on the left side of your screen. To show system datasets, click the filter icon.

![Data Ingestion](./images/menudsjo.png)

Enable the option **Show system datasets** and search for **AJO**. You'll then see the datasets used for push notifications.

## 10.4.2 Datastream for Mobile

Go to [https://experience.adobe.com/#/data-collection/](https://experience.adobe.com/#/data-collection/). 

In the left menu, go to **[!UICONTROL Datastream]** and search for your datastream that you created in [Exercise 0.2](./../module0/ex2.md), which is named `--demoProfileLdap-- - Demo System Datastream (Mobile)`. Click to open it.

![Click Datastream icon in the left navigation](./images/edgeconfig1a.png)

Click **Edit** on the **Adobe Experience Platform** service.

![Click Datastream icon in the left navigation](./images/edgeconfig1.png)

You'll then see the datastream settings that were defined, and into which datasets events and profile attributes will be stored.

![Name the Datastream and save](./images/edgeconfig2.png)

No changes are needed, your datastream is now ready to be used in your Data Collection Client property for Mobile.

## 10.4.3 Review your Data Collection property for Mobile

Go to [https://experience.adobe.com/#/data-collection/](https://experience.adobe.com/#/data-collection/). As part of [Exercise 0.1](./../module0/ex1.md), 2 Data Collection properties were created. 
You've been using these Data Collection Client properties already as part of previous modules. 

Click to open the Data Collection property for mobile.

You'll then see a QR code on your screen, which you should scan with your iOS device.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection](./images/griffon6.png)

On your mobile device, open the camera app and scan the QR code that is displayed by AEP Assurance.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection](./images/ipadPushTest8a.png)

You'll then see a popup screen, asking you to enter the PIN-code. Copy the PIN-code from your AEP Assurance screen and click **Connect**.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection](./images/ipadPushTest9.png)

You'll then see this.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection](./images/ipadPushTest11.png)

In AEP Assurance, you'll now see that a devicer is to the AEP Assurance session.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection](./images/griffon7.png)

Go to **Push Debug**. You'll see something like this.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection](./images/griffon10.png)

Some explanation:

- The first column, **Client**, shows the available identifiers on your iOS device. You'll see an ECID and a Push Token.
- The second column shows **Profile** information, with additional info on what platform the Push Token lives in (APNS or APNSSandbox). If you click the **Inspect Profile** button, you'll be taken to Adobe Experience Platform and you'll see the full Real-time Customer Profile.
- The 3rd column shows the **App Configuration**, which was set up as part of exercise **10.5.4 Create App Configuration in Launch**

To test your Push configuration setup, click the **Send Push Notification** button. 

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection](./images/griffon11.png)

You need to make sure that the **DX Demo** app isn't open at the time of clicking the **Send Push Notification** button. If the app is open, the Push Notification might be received in the background and wouldn't be visible.

You'll then see a push notification like this one appear on your mobile device.
