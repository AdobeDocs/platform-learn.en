Login to Adobe Journey Optimizer by going to [Adobe Experience Cloud](https://experience.adobe.com). Click **Journey Optimizer**.

![ACOP](../module7/images/acophome.png)

You'll be redirected to the **Home**  view in Journey Optimizer. First, make sure you're using the correct sandbox. The sandbox to use is called `--aepSandboxId--`. To change from one sandbox to another, click on **PRODUCTION Prod (VA7)** and select the sandbox from the list. In this example, the sandbox is named **AEP Enablement FY22**. You'll then be in the **Home** view of your sandbox `--aepSandboxId--`.

## 10.2.1 Create newsletter journey

You'll now create a batch-based journey. Unlike the event-based journey of the previous exercise which relies on incoming experience events or segment entries or exits to trigger a journey for 1 specific customer, batch-based journeys target a whole segment once with unique content like newsletters, one-off promotions, or generic information or periodically with similar content sent on a regular basis like for instance birthday campaigns and reminders. 

In the menu, go to **Journeys** and click **Create Journey**.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc43.png)

On the right-hand side you will see a form where you need to specify the journey name and description. Enter the following values:

- **Name**: `--demoProfileLdap-- - Newsletter Journey`. For instance: **vangeluw - Newsletter Journey**.
- **Description**: Monthly Newsletter

Click **Ok**. 

![Journey Optimizer](./images/batchj2.png)

Under **Orchestration**, drag and drop **Read Segment** onto the canvas. This means that, once published, the journey will start by retrieving the whole segment audience, which then becomes the target audience of the journey and message. Click **Select a segment**.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/batchj3.png)

In the **Choose a segment** popup, search for your ldap and select the segment you created in [Module 6 - Real-time CDP - Build a segment and take action](../module6/real-time-cdp-build-a-segment-take-action.md) named `--demoProfileLdap-- - Interest in PROTEUS FITNESS JACKSHIRT`. for example: vangeluw - Interest in PROTEUS FITNESS JACKSHIRT. Click **Save**.

Click **Ok**.

In the left menu, find the **Actions** section and drag and drop an **Email** action onto the canvas.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/batchj7.png)

Set the **Category** to **Marketing** and select an email surface that enables you to send email. In this case, the email surface to select is **Email**. Ensure that the checkboxes for **Clicks on email** and **email opens** are both enabled.

In the pop-up screen, you'll need to drag and drop the HTML file of the email. You can find the HTML template [here](../../assets/html/ajo-newsletter.html.zip). Download the zip-file with the HTML template to your local machine and unzip in onto your desktop.

This email content is ready to go since it has all the expected personalization, imagery and text. Only the offer placeholder is left empty. 

You might get an error message: **Error when trying to fetch assets**. This is linked to the image in the email.

If you get this error, select the image and click the **Edit image** button.

You'll then see this. Select **Once**.
