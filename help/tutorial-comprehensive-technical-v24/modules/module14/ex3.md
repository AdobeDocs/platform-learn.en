# 14.3 Create and configure a custom webhook

## 14.3.1 Create your custom webhook

Go to [https://webhook.site/](https://webhook.site/). You'll see something like this:

![demo](./images/webhook1.png)

You'll see your unique URL, which looks like this: `https://webhook.site/585126a1-41fc-4721-864b-d4aa8c268a1d`.

This website has now created this webhook for you, and you'll be able to configure this webhook in your **[!DNL Event Forwarding property]** to start testing the forwarding of events.

## 14.3.2 Update your Event Forwarding property: Create a Data Element

Go to [https://experience.adobe.com/#/data-collection/](https://experience.adobe.com/#/data-collection/) and go to **Event Forwarding**. Search your Event Forwarding property and click it to open it.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/prop1.png)

In the left menu, go to **Data Elements**. Click **Create New Data Element**.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/de1.png)

You'll then see a new data element to configure.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/de2.png)

Make the following selection:

- As the **Name**, enter **XDM Event**.
- As the **Extension**, select **Core**.
- As the **Data Element Type**, select **Path**.
- As the **Path**, enter **arc.event.xdm**. By entering this path, you'll be filtering out the **XDM** section from the event payload that is sent by the website or mobile app into the Adobe Edge.

You'll now have this. Click **Save**.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/de3.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
>In the above path, a reference is made to **arc**. **arc** stands for Adobe Resource Context and **arc** always stands for the highest available object that is available in the Server Side context. Enrichments and transformations may be added to that **arc** object using Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Server functions.
>
>In the above path, a reference is made to **event**. **event** stands for a unique event and Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Server will always evaluate every event individually. Sometimes, you may see a reference to **events** in the payload sent by Web SDK Client Side, but in Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Server, every event is evaluated individually.

## 14.3.3 Update your Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Server property: Create a Rule

In the left menu, go to **Rules**. Click **Create New Rule**.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/rl1.png)

You'll then see a new rule to configure. Enter the **Name**: **All Pages**. For this exercise, you won't need to configure a condition. Instead, you'll setup an action. Click the **+ Add** button under **Actions**.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/rl2.png)

You'll then see this. Make the following selection:

- Select the **Extension**: **Adobe Cloud Connector**.
- Select the **Action Type**: **Make Fetch Call**.

That should give you this **Name**: **Adobe Cloud Connector - Make Fetch Call**. You should now see this:

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/rl4.png)

Next, configure the following:

- Change the request method from GET to **POST**
- Enter the URL of the custom webhook you created in one of the previous steps on the [https://webhook.site/](https://webhook.site/) website, which looks like this: `https://webhook.site/585126a1-41fc-4721-864b-d4aa8c268a1d`

You should now have this. Next, go to **Body**.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/rl6.png)

You'll then see this. Click the data element icon as indicated below.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/rl7.png)

In the popup, select the data element **XDM Event** which you created in the previous step. Click **Select**.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/rl8.png)

You'll then see this. Click **Keep Changes**.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/rl9.png)

You'll then see this. Click **Save**.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/rl10.png)

You've now configured your first rule in an Event Forwarding property. Go to **Publishing Flow** to publish your changes.
Open your Development library **Main** by clicking **Edit** as indicated.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/rl11.png)

Click the **Add All Changed Resources** button, after which you'll see your Rule and Data Element appear in this library. Next, click **Save & Build for Development**. Your changes are now being deployed.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/rl13.png)

After a couple of minutes, you'll see that the deployment is done and ready to be tested.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/rl14.png)

## 14.3.4 Test your configuration

Go to [https://builder.adobedemo.com/projects](https://builder.adobedemo.com/projects). After logging in with your Adobe ID, you'll see this. Click your website project to open it.

![DSN](../module0/images/web8.png)

You can now follow the below flow to access the website. Click **Integrations**.

![DSN](../module0/images/web1.png)

On the **Integrations** page, you need to select the Data Collection property that was created in exercise 0.1. 

![DSN](../module0/images/web2.png)

You'll then see your demo website open up. Select the URL and copy it to your clipboard.

![DSN](../module0/images/web3.png)

Open a new incognito browser window.

![DSN](../module0/images/web4.png)

Paste the URL of your demo website, which you copied in the previous step. You'll then be asked to login using your Adobe ID.

![DSN](../module0/images/web5.png)

Select your account type and complete the login process.

![DSN](../module0/images/web6.png)

You'll then see your website loaded in an incognito browser window. For every demonstration, you'll need to use a fresh, incognito browser window to load your demo website URL.

![DSN](../module0/images/web7.png)

When you open up your browser Developer View, you can inspect Network requests as indicated below. When you use the filter **interact**, you'll see the network requests that are sent by Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Client to the Adobe Edge.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Setup](./images/hook1.png)

If you select the raw payload, go to [https://jsonformatter.org/json-pretty-print](https://jsonformatter.org/json-pretty-print) and paste the payload. Click **Make Pretty**. You'll then see the JSON payload, the **events** object and the **xdm** object. In one of the previous steps, when you defined the Data Element, you used the reference **arc.event.xdm**, which will result in you parsing out the **xdm** object of this payload.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Setup](./images/hook2.png)

Switch your view to the website [https://webhook.site/](https://webhook.site/) which you used in one of the previous steps. You should now have a view similar to this one, with network requests being shown in the left menu. You're seeing the **xdm** payload that was filter out of the network request that was shown above. 

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Setup](./images/hook3.png)

Scroll down a bit in the payload to find the page name, which in this case is **vangeluw-OCUC** (which is the project name of your demo website).

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Setup](./images/hook4.png)

If you now navigate across the website, you'll see additional network requests becoming available on this custom webhook in real-time.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Setup](./images/hook5.png)

You've now configured the Server Side Forwarding of Web SDK/XDM payloads to an external custom webhook. In the next exercises, you'll configure a similar approach, and you'll be sending that same data towards Google and AWS environments.
