# 14.4 Create and configure a Google Cloud Function

## 14.4.1 Create your Google Cloud Function

Go to [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/). Go to **Cloud Functions**.

![GCP](./images/gcp1.png)

You'll then see this. Click **CREATE FUNCTION**.

![GCP](./images/gcp2.png)

You'll then see this.

![GCP](./images/gcp6.png)

Make the following choices:

- **Function name**: `--demoProfileLdap---event-forwarding`
- **Region**: select any region
- **Trigger Type**: select **HTTP**
- **Authentication**: select **Allow unauthenticated invocations**

You should now have this. Click **SAVE**.

![GCP](./images/gcp7.png)

Click **NEXT**.

![GCP](./images/gcp8.png)

You'll then see this:

![GCP](./images/gcp9.png)

Make the following choices:

- **Runtime**: select **Node.js 16** (or more recent)
- **Entry point**: enter **helloAEP**

Click **ENABLE API** to enable **Cloud Build API**. You'll then see a new window. In that new window, click **ENABLE** again.

![GCP](./images/gcp10.png)

You'll then see this. Click **Enable**.

![GCP](./images/gcp11.png)

Once **Cloud Build API** has been enabled, you'll see this.

![GCP](./images/gcp12.png)

Go back to your **Cloud Function**.
In your Cloud Function Inline Editor, make sure you have the following code there:

```javascript
/**
 * Responds to any HTTP request.
 *
 * @param {!express:Request} req HTTP request context.
 * @param {!express:Response} res HTTP response context.
 */
exports.helloAEP = (req, res) => {
  let message = req.query.message || req.body.message || 'Hello World!';
  res.status(200).send(message);
};
```

Next, click **DEPLOY**.

![GCP](./images/gcp13.png)

You'll then see this. Your Cloud Function is now being created. This may take a couple of minutes.

![GCP](./images/gcp14.png)

Once your function is created and running, you'll see this. Click on your function's name to open it.

![GCP](./images/gcp15.png)

You'll then see this. Go to **TRIGGER**. You'll then see the **Trigger URL** which is what you'll use to define the endpoint in Launch Server Side.

![GCP](./images/gcp16.png)

Copy the Trigger URL, which looks like this: **https://europe-west1-dazzling-pillar-273812.cloudfunctions.net/vangeluw-event-forwarding**.

In the next steps, you'll configure Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Server to stream specific information about **Page Views** to your Google Cloud Function. Instead of just forwarding the full payload as-is, you'll only send things like **ECID**, **timestamp** and **Page Name** to your Google Cloud Function.

Here's an example of a payload that you'll need to parse to filter out the above mentioned variables:

```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "xdm": {
        "eventType": "web.webpagedetails.pageViews",
        "web": {
          "webPageDetails": {
            "URL": "https://builder.adobedemo.com/run/vangeluw-OCUC",

    }
  ],
  "query": {

        "ECID"
      ]
    }
  },
  "meta": {

      "domain": "adobedemo.com",
      "cookiesEnabled": true,
      "entries": [
        {
          "key": "kndctr_907075E95BF479EC0A495C73_AdobeOrg_identity",
          "value": "CiYwODM0Njk2OTg1NjkyOTQ0NDg1MDU5MDM2NTQ5NTk0OTU2MTI0OVIPCPn66KfyLxgBKgRJUkwx8AH5-uin8i8="
        },
        {
          "key": "kndctr_907075E95BF479EC0A495C73_AdobeOrg_consent_check",
          "value": "1"
        },
        {
          "key": "kndctr_907075E95BF479EC0A495C73_AdobeOrg_consent",
          "value": "general=in"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

These are the fields that contain the information that needs to be parsed out:

- ECID: **events.xdm._experienceplatform.identification.core.ecid**
- timestamp: **timestamp**
- Page Name: **events.xdm.web.webPageDetails.name**

Let's go to Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Server now, to configure the data elements to make that possible.

## 14.4.2 Update your Event Forwarding property: Data Elements

Go to [https://experience.adobe.com/#/data-collection/](https://experience.adobe.com/#/data-collection/) and go to **Event Forwarding**. Search your Event Forwarding property and click it to open it.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/prop1.png)

In the left menu, go to **Data Elements**. Click **Add Data Element**.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/de1gcp.png)

You'll then see a new data element to configure.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/de2gcp.png)

Make the following selection:

- As the **Name**, enter **customerECID**.
- As the **Extension**, select **Core**.
- As the **Data Element Type**, select **Path**.
- As the **Path**, enter `arc.event.xdm.--aepTenantId--.identification.core.ecid`. By entering this path, you'll be filtering out the field **ecid** from the event payload that is sent by the website or mobile app into the Adobe Edge.

>[!NOTE]
>
>In the above and below paths, a reference is made to **arc**. **arc** stands for Adobe Resource Context and **arc** always stands for the highest available object that is available in the Server Side context. Enrichments and transformations may be added to that **arc** object using Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Server functions.
>
>In the above and below paths, a reference is made to **event**. **event** stands for a unique event and Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Server will always evaluate every event individually. Sometimes, you may see a reference to **events** in the payload sent by Web SDK Client Side, but in Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Server, every event is evaluated individually.

You'll now have this. Click **Save**.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/gcdpde1.png)

Click **Add Data Element**.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/addde.png)

You'll then see a new data element to configure.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/de2gcp.png)

Make the following selection:

- As the **Name**, enter **eventTimestamp**.
- As the **Extension**, select **Core**.
- As the **Data Element Type**, select **Path**.
- As the **Path**, enter **arc.event.xdm.timestamp**. By entering this path, you'll be filtering out the field **timestamp** from the event payload that is sent by the website or mobile app into the Adobe Edge.

You'll now have this. Click **Save**.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/gcdpde2.png)

Click **Add Data Element**.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/addde.png)

You'll then see a new data element to configure.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/de2gcp.png)

Make the following selection:

- As the **Name**, enter **pageName**.
- As the **Extension**, select **Core**.
- As the **Data Element Type**, select **Path**.
- As the **Path**, enter **arc.event.xdm.web.webPageDetails.name**. By entering this path, you'll be filtering out the field **name** from the event payload that is sent by the website or mobile app into the Adobe Edge.

You'll now have this. Click **Save**.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/gcdpde3.png)

You now have these data elements created:

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/de3gcp.png)

## 14.4.3 Update your Event Forwarding property: Update a Rule

In the left menu, go to **Rules**. In the previous exercise, you created the rule **All Pages**. Click that rule to open it.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/rl1gcp.png)

You'll then this. Click the **+** icon under **Actions** to add a new action. 

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/rl2gcp.png)

You'll then see this.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/rl4gcp.png)

Make the following selection:

- Select the **Extension**: **Adobe Cloud Connector**.
- Select the **Action Type**: **Make Fetch Call**.

That should give you this **Name**: **Adobe Cloud Connector - Make Fetch Call**. You should now see this:

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/rl5gcp.png)

Next, configure the following:

- Change the request protocol from GET to **POST**
- Enter the URL of the Google Cloud Function you created in one of the previous steps which looks like this: **https://europe-west1-dazzling-pillar-273812.cloudfunctions.net/vangeluw-event-forwarding**

You should now have this. Next, go to **Body**.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/rl6gcp.png)

You'll then see this. Click the radio button for **JSON**.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/rl7gcp.png)

Configure the **Body** as follows:

| KEY | VALUE | 
|--- |--- |
|customerECID|{{customerECID}}|
|pageName|{{pageName}}|
|eventTimestamp|{{eventTimestamp}}|

You'll then see this. Click **Keep Changes**.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/rl9gcp.png)

You'll then see this. Click **Save**.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/rl10gcp.png)

You've now update your existing rule in a Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Server property. Go to **Publishing Flow** to publish your changes. Open your Development library **Main** by clicking **Edit** as indicated.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/rl12gcp.png)

Click the **Add All Changed Resources** button, after which you'll see your Rule and Data Element appear in this library. Next, click **Save & Build for Development**. Your changes are now being deployed.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/rl13gcp.png)

After a couple of minutes, you'll see that the deployment is done and ready to be tested.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection SSF](./images/rl14.png)

## 14.3.4 Test your configuration

Go to [https://builder.adobedemo.com/projects](https://builder.adobedemo.com/projects). After logging in with your Adobe ID, you'll see this. Click your website project to open it.

![DSN](../module0/images/web8.png)

You can now follow the below flow to access the website. Click **Integrations**.

![DSN](../module0/images/web1.png)

On the **Integrations** page, you need to select the Data Collection property that was created in exercise 0.1. 

![DSN](../module0/images/web2.png)

You'll then see your demo website open up. Select the URL and copy it to your clipboard.

![DSN](../module0/images/web3.png)

Open a new incognito browser window.

![DSN](../module0/images/web4.png)

Paste the URL of your demo website, which you copied in the previous step. You'll then be asked to login using your Adobe ID.

![DSN](../module0/images/web5.png)

Select your account type and complete the login process.

![DSN](../module0/images/web6.png)

You'll then see your website loaded in an incognito browser window. For every demonstration, you'll need to use a fresh, incognito browser window to load your demo website URL.

![DSN](../module0/images/web7.png)

When you open up your browser Developer View, you can inspect Network requests as indicated below. When you use the filter **interact**, you'll see the network requests that are sent by Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Client to the Adobe Edge.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Setup](./images/hook1.png)

Switch your view to your Google Cloud Function and go to **LOGS**. You should now have a view similar to this one, with a number of log entries being shown. Every time you see **Function execution started**, it means that incoming traffic was received in your Google Cloud Function.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Setup](./images/hook3gcp.png)

Let's update your function a bit to work with the incoming data, and display the information that was received from Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Server. Go to **SOURCE** and click **EDIT**.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Setup](./images/hook4gcp.png)

In the next screen, click **NEXT**.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Setup](./images/gcf1.png)

Update your code like this:

```javascript
/**
 * Responds to any HTTP request.
 *
 * @param {!express:Request} req HTTP request context.
 * @param {!express:Response} res HTTP response context.
 */
exports.helloAEP = (req, res) => {
  console.log('>>>>> Function has started. The following information was received from Event Forwarding:');
  console.log(req.body);

  let message = req.query.message || req.body.message || 'Hello World!';
  res.status(200).send(message);
};
```

You'll then have this. Click **DEPLOY**.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Setup](./images/gcf2.png)

After a couple of minutes, your function will be deployed again. Click your function name to open it.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Setup](./images/gcf3.png)

On your demo website, navigate to a product, like for instance **DEIRDRE RELAXED-FIT CAPRI**.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Setup](./images/gcf3a.png)

Switch your view to your Google Cloud Function and go to **LOGS**. You should now have a view similar to this one, with a number of log entries being shown.

For every page view on your demo website, you should now see a new log entry pop up in your Google Cloud Function's logs, which shows the received information.

![Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Setup](./images/gcf4.png)

You've now successfully sent data that was collected by Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection, in real-time, to a Google Cloud Function endpoint. From there, that data can be used by any Google Cloud Platform application, such as BigQuery for storage and reporting or for Machine Learning use cases.
