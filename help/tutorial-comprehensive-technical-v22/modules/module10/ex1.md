# 10.1 Configure a trigger-based journey - Order Confirmation

Login to Adobe Journey Optimizer by going to [Adobe Experience Cloud](https://experience.adobe.com). Click **Journey Optimizer**.

![ACOP](../module7/images/acophome.png)

You'll be redirected to the **Home**  view in Journey Optimizer. First, make sure you're using the correct sandbox. The sandbox to use is called `--aepSandboxId--`. To change from one sandbox to another, click on **PRODUCTION Prod (VA7)** and select the sandbox from the list. In this example, the sandbox is named **AEP Enablement FY22**. You'll then be in the **Home** view of your sandbox `--aepSandboxId--`.

## 10.1.1 Create your event

In the menu, go to **Configurations** and click **Manage** under **Events**.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc30.png)

On the **Events** screen, you'll see a view similar to this. Click **Create Event**.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc31.png)

You'll then see an empty event configuration.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc32.png)

First of all, give your Event a Name like this: `--demoProfileLdap--PurchaseEvent`, and add a description like this: `Purchase Event`.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc34.png)

Next is the **Event Type** selection. Select **Unitary**.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/eventidtype1.png)

Next is the **Event ID Type** selection. Select **System Generated**

![Journey Optimizer](./images/eventidtype.png)

Next is the Schema selection. A schema was prepared for this exercise. Please use the schema `Demo System - Event Schema for Website (Global v1.1) v.1`.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc35.png)

After selecting the Schema, you'll see a number of fields being selected in the **Payload** section. Click the **Edit/Pencil** icon to add additional fields to this event.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc36.png)

You'll then see this popup. You now need to check additional checkboxes in order to access additional data when this event gets triggered.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc37.png)

First of all, check the checkbox on the line `--aepTenantId--`.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc38.png)

Next, scroll down and check the checkbox on the line `productListItems`. 

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc39.png)

Next, scroll down and check the checkbox on the line `commerce`. 

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc391.png)

Next, click **Ok**.

You'll then see that additional fields have been added to the event. Click **Save**.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc40.png)

Your new event is then shared and you'll see your event in the list of available events now.

Click on your event again to open up the **Edit Event** screen again. 
Hover over the **Payload** field again to see the 3 icons again. Click on the **View Payload** icon. 

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc41.png)

You'll now see an example of the expected payload. Your event has a unique orchestration eventID, which you can find by scrolling down in that payload until you see `_experience.campaign.orchestration.eventID`.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc42.png)

The event ID is what needs to be sent to Adobe Journey Optimizer in order to trigger the journey that you'll build in the next step. Write down this eventID, as you'll need it in one of the next steps.
`"eventID": "ef6dd943c94fe1b4763c098ccd1772344662f2a9f614513106cb5ada8be36857"`

Click **Ok**, followed by **Cancel**.

Your event is now configured and ready to be used.

## 10.1.2 Create your journey

In the menu, go to **Journeys** and click **Create Journey**.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc43.png)

You'll then see this. Give your journey a name. Use `--demoProfileLdap-- - Order Confirmation journey`. Click **OK**.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc45.png)

First, you need to add your event as the starting point of your journey. Search for your event `--demoProfileLdap--PurchaseEvent` and drag and drop it onto the canvas. Click **OK**.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc46.png)

Next, under **Actions**, search for the **Email** action and add it onto the canvas.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc47.png)

Set the **Category** to **Marketing** and select an email surface that enables you to send email. In this case, the email surface to select is **Email**. Ensure that the checkboxes for **Clicks on email** and **email opens** are both enabled.

![ACOP](./images/journeyactions1.png)

The next step is to create your message. To do that, click **Edit content**.

![ACOP](./images/journeyactions2.png)

You now see this. Click the **Subject line** text field.

![ACOP](./images/journeyactions3.png)

In the text area start writing **Thanks for your order,**

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc5.png)

The subject line is not done yet. Next you need to bring in the personalization token for the field **First name** which is stored under `profile.person.name.firstName`. In the left menu, scroll down to find the **Person** > **Full name** >  **First name** field and click on the **+** icon to add the personalization token into the subject line. Click **Save**.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc6.png)

You'll then be back here. Click **Email Designer** to create the email's content. 

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc7.png)

In the next screen, click **Design from scratch**.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc8.png)

In the left menu, you'll find the structure components that you can use to define the structure of the email (rows and columns).

Drag and drop 8 times a **1:1 column** on the canvas, which should give you this:

Go to **Content Components**.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc10.png)

Drag and drop an **Image** component on the first row. Click **Browse**.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc11.png)

Go to the folder **enablement-assets**, select the file **luma-logo.png** and click **Select**.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc12.png)

You're now back here. Click your image to select it and then use the **Size** slider to make the logo image a bit smaller.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc13.png)

Go to **Content Components** and drag and drop an **Image** component on the second row. Select the **Image component** but DON'T click Browse.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc15.png)

Paste this image URl in the field **Source**: `https://parsefiles.back4app.com/hgJBdVOS2eff03JCn6qXXOxT5jJFzialLAHJixD9/29043bedcde632a9cbe8a02a164189c9_preparing.png`. This image is hosted outside of Adobe.

Next, go to **Content Components** and drag and drop a **Text** component on the third row. 

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc17.png)

Select the default text in that component **Please type your text here.** and replace it by the below text:

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc22.png)

Next, go to **Content Components** and drag and drop an **HTML** component on the fifth row. Click the HTML component and then click **Show the source code**.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc24.png)

You'll then have this:

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc58.png)

You now have to replace **xxx** by a reference to the productListItems object that is part of the event that triggers the journey.

First, delete **xxx** in your HTML code first.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc60.png)

There are 2 references of **xxx** in this HTML code. You now have to replace each **xxx** by a reference to the productListItems object that is part of the event that triggers the journey.

First, delete the first **xxx** in your HTML code.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc71.png)

## 10.1.5 Update your Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Client property

Go to [Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection](https://experience.adobe.com/launch/) and select **Tags**.

This is the Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Properties page you saw before.

![Properties page](../module1/images/launch1.png) 

In module 0, Demo System created two Client properties for you: one for the website and one for the mobile app. Find them by searching for `--demoProfileLdap--` in the **[!UICONTROL Search]** box. Click to open the **Web** property.

![Search box](../module1/images/property6.png)

Go to **Data Elements**. Search and open the data element **XDM - Purchase**.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc91.png)

You'll then see this. Navigate to the field **_experience.campaign.orchestration.eventID** and fill out your eventID here. The eventID to fill out here, is the eventID you created as part of exercise 10.1.2. Click **Save** or **Save to Library**.

![Journey Optimizer](./images/oc92.png)

Save your changes in your Client property, and then publish your changes by updating your development library.
