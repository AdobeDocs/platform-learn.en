# 8.5 Trigger your journey

In this exercise, you'll test and trigger the journey you configured in this module.

## 8.5.1 Update your geofence event configuration

Go to [Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection](https://experience.adobe.com/launch/) and select **Tags**.

This is the Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Properties page you saw before.

![Properties page](../module1/images/launch1.png) 

In module 0, Demo System created two Client properties for you: one for the website and one for the mobile app. Find them by searching for `--demoProfileLdap--` in the **[!UICONTROL Search]** box. Click to open the **Web** property.

![Search box](../module1/images/property6.png)

You'll then see this.

![Launch Setup](./images/rule1.png)

In the left menu, go to **Rules** and search for the rule **Geofence event**. Click the rule **Geofence event** to open it.

![Launch Setup](./images/rule2.png)

You'll then see the details of this rule. Click to open the action **Send "geofence event" to AEP - trigger JO**.

![Launch Setup](./images/rule3.png)

You'll then see that when this action is triggered, a specific data element is used to define the XDM data structure. You need to update that data element, and you need to define the **Event ID** of the event that you configured in [Exercise 8.1](./ex1.md).

![Launch Setup](./images/rule4.png)

You now need to go update the data element **XDM - Geofence Event**. To do so, go to **Data Elements**. Search for **XDM - Geofence Event** and click to open that data element.

![Launch Setup](./images/rule5.png)

You'll then see this:

![Launch Setup](./images/rule6.png)

Navigate to the field `_experience.campaign.orchestration.eventID`. Remove the current value, and paste your eventID there.

As a reminder, the Event ID can be found in Adobe Journey Optimizer under **Configurations > Events** and you'll find the event ID in the sample payload of your even, which looks like this: `"eventID": "fa42ab7982ba55f039eacec24c1e32e5c51b310c67f0fa559ab49b89b63f4934"`.

Next, you should define your city in this data element. Go to **placeContext > geo > city** and enter a city of choice. Next, click **Save** or **Save to Library**.

![ACOP](./images/payloadeventIDgeo.png)

Finally, you need to publish your changes. Go to **Publishing Flow** in the left menu.

Click **Add All Changed Resources** and then click **Save & Build to Development**.
