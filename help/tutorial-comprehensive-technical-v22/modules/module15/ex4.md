# 15.4 Install and configure Kafka Connect and the Adobe Experience Platform Sink Connector

## 15.4.1 Download the Adobe Experience Platform Sink Connector

Go to [https://github.com/adobe/experience-platform-streaming-connect/releases](https://github.com/adobe/experience-platform-streaming-connect/releases) and download the latest official release of the Adobe Experience Platform Sink Connector.

![Kafka](./images/kc1.png)

Place the download file, **streaming-connect-sink-0.0.14-java-11.jar**, onto your desktop.

![Kafka](./images/kc2.png)

## 15.4.2 Configure Kafka Connect

Go to the folder on your desktop named **Kafka_AEP** and navigate to the folder `kafka_2.13-3.1.0/config`.
In that folder, open the file **connect-distributed.properties** using any Text Editor.

![Kafka](./images/kc3a.png)

In your Text Editor, go to line 34 and 35 and make sure to set the fields `key.converter.schemas.enable` and `value.converter.schemas.enable` to `false`

```json
key.converter.schemas.enable=false
value.converter.schemas.enable=false
```

Save your changes to this file.

![Kafka](./images/kc3.png)

Next, go back to the folder `kafka_2.13-3.1.0` and manually create a new folder, and name it `connectors`.

![Kafka](./images/kc4.png)

Right-click the folder and click **New terminal at Folder**.

![Kafka](./images/kc5.png)

You'll then see this. Enter the command `pwd` to retrieve the full path for that folder. Select the full path and copy it to your clipboard.

![Kafka](./images/kc6.png)

Go back to your Text Editor, to the file **connect-distributed.properties** and scroll down to the last line (line 86 in the screenshot). You should uncomment the line that starts with `# plugin.path=` and you should paste the full path to the folder named `connectors`. The result should look similar to this:

`plugin.path=/Users/woutervangeluwe/Desktop/Kafka_AEP/kafka_2.13-3.1.0/connectors` 

Save your changes to the file **connect-distributed.properties** and close your Text Editor.

![Kafka](./images/kc7.png)

Next, copy the latest official release of the Adobe Experience Platform Sink Connector that you downloaded into the folder named `connectors`. The file that you downloaded before is named **streaming-connect-sink-0.0.14-java-11.jar**, you can simply move it into the `connectors` folder.

![Kafka](./images/kc8.png)

Next, open a new Terminal window at the level of the **kafka_2.13-3.1.0** folder. Right-click that folder and click **New Terminal at Folder**.

In the Terminal window, paste this command: `bin/connect-distributed.sh config/connect-distributed.properties` and click **Enter**. This command will start Kafka Connect and will load the library of the Adobe Experience Platform Sink Connector.

![Kafka](./images/kc9.png)

After a couple of seconds, you'll see something like this:

![Kafka](./images/kc10.png)

## 15.4.3 Create your Adobe Experience Platform Sink Connector using Postman

You can now interact with Kafka Connect using Postman. To do so, download [this Postman Collection](../../assets/postman/postman_kafka.zip) and uncompress it to your local computer on the desktop. You'll then have a file that is called `Kafka_AEP.postman_collection.json`.

![Kafka](./images/kc11a.png)

You need to import this file in Postman. To do so, open Postman, click **Import**, drag and drop the file `Kafka_AEP.postman_collection.json` into the popup and click **Import**.

![Kafka](./images/kc11b.png)

You'll then find this collection in the left menu of Postman. Click the first request, **GET Available Kafka Connect connectors** to open it.

![Kafka](./images/kc11c.png)

You'll then see this. Click the blue **Send** button, after which you should see an empty response `[]`. The empty response is due to the fact that no Kafka Connect connectors are currently defined.

![Kafka](./images/kc11.png)

To create a connector, click to open the second request in the Kafka collection, **POST Create AEP Sink Connector**. You'll then see this. On line 11, where it says **"aep.endpoint": ""**, you need to paste in the HTTP API Streaming endpoint URL that you received at the end of exercise [15.3](./ex3.md). The HTTP API Streaming endpoint URL looks like this: `https://dcs.adobedc.net/collection/d282bbfc8a540321341576275a8d052e9dc4ea80625dd9a5fe5b02397cfd80dc`.

![Kafka](./images/kc12a.png)

After pasting it, the body of your request should look like this. Click the blue **Send** button to create your connector. You'll get an immediate response of the creation of your connector.

![Kafka](./images/kc12.png)

Click the first request, **GET Available Kafka Connect connectors** to open it again and click the blue **Send** button again. you'll now see that a Kafka Connect connector is created.

![Kafka](./images/kc13.png)

Next, open the third request in the Kafka collection, **GET Check Kafka Connect Connector Status**. Click the blue **Send** button, you'll then get a response like the one below, stating that the connector is running.

![Kafka](./images/kc14.png)

## 15.4.4 Produce an experience event

Open a new **Terminal** window by right-clicking your folder **kafka_2.13-3.1.0** and clicking **New Terminal at Folder**.

![Kafka](./images/kafka11.png)

Enter the following command:

`bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic aep`

![Kafka](./images/kc15.png)

You'll then see this. Every new line followed by pushing the Enter button will result in a new message being sent into the topic **aep**.

![Kafka](./images/kc16.png)

You can now send a message, which will result in being consumed by the Adobe Experience Platform Sink Connector, and which will be ingested into Adobe Experience Platform in real-time.

Let's do a little demo to test this.

Go to [https://builder.adobedemo.com/projects](https://builder.adobedemo.com/projects). After logging in with your Adobe ID, you'll see this. Click your website project to open it.

![DSN](../module0/images/web8.png)

On the **Screens** page, click **Run**. 

![DSN](../module1/images/web2.png)

You'll then see your demo website open up. Select the URL and copy it to your clipboard.

![DSN](../module0/images/web3.png)

Open a new incognito browser window.

![DSN](../module0/images/web4.png)

Paste the URL of your demo website, which you copied in the previous step. You'll then be asked to login using your Adobe ID.

![DSN](../module0/images/web5.png)

Select your account type and complete the login process.

![DSN](../module0/images/web6.png)

You'll then see your website loaded in an incognito browser window. For every demonstration, you'll need to use a fresh, incognito browser window to load your demo website URL.

![DSN](../module0/images/web7.png)

Click the Adobe logo icon in the top left corner of your screen to open the Profile Viewer.
  
![Demo](../module2/images/pv1.png)

Have a look at the Profile Viewer panel and the Real-time Customer Profile with the **Experience Cloud ID** as the primary identifier for thi currently unknown customer.
      
![Demo](../module2/images/pv2.png)

Go to the Register/Login page. Click **CREATE AN ACCOUNT**.
  
![Demo](../module2/images/pv9.png)
  
Fill out your details and click **Register** after which you'll be redirected to the previous page. 

![Demo](../module2/images/pv10.png)

Open the Profile Viewer panel and go to Real-time Customer Profile. On the Profile Viewer panel, you should see all of your personal data displayed, like your newly added email and phone identifiers.
  
![Demo](../module2/images/pv11.png)

You may see some experience events based on past activity.

![Kafka](./images/kc19.png)

Let's change that and send in a Callcenter experience event from Kafka into Adobe Experience Platform.

Take the below sample experience event payload and copy it into a Text Editor.

```json
{
  "header": {
    "datasetId": "61fe23fd242870194a6d779c",
    "imsOrgId": "--aepImsOrgID--",
    "source": {
      "name": "Launch"
    },
    "schemaRef": {
      "id": "https://ns.adobe.com/experienceplatform/schemas/b0190276c6e1e1e99cf56c99f4c07a6e517bf02091dcec90",
      "contentType": "application/vnd.adobe.xed-full+json;version=1"
    }
  },
  "body": {
    "xdmMeta": {
      "schemaRef": {
        "id": "https://ns.adobe.com/experienceplatform/schemas/b0190276c6e1e1e99cf56c99f4c07a6e517bf02091dcec90",
        "contentType": "application/vnd.adobe.xed-full+json;version=1"
      }
    },
    "xdmEntity": {
      "eventType": "callCenterInteractionKafka",
      "_id": "",
      "timestamp": "2022-02-23T09:54:12.232Z",
      "_experienceplatform": {
        "identification": {
          "core": {
            "phoneNumber": ""
          }
        },
        "interactionDetails": {
          "core": {
            "callCenterAgent": {
              "callID": "Support Contact - 3767767",
              "callTopic": "contract",
              "callFeeling": "negative"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You'll then see this. You need to manually update 2 fields:

- **_id**: please set it to a random id, something like `--demoProfileLdap--1234`
- **timestamp**: update the timestamp to the current date and time
- **phoneNumber**: enter the phoneNumber of the account that was just created on the demo website. You can find it on the Profile Viewer panel under **Identities**.

You also need to check and maybe update these fields:
- **datasetId**: you need to copy the Dataset ID for the dataset Demo System - Event Dataset for Call Center (Global v1.1)
- **imsOrgID**: your IMS Org ID is `--aepImsOrgId--`

>[!NOTE]
>
>The field **_id** needs to be unique for every data ingestion. If you produce multiple events, please make sure that you update the field **_id** every time to a new, unique value.

![Kafka](./images/kc20.png)

You should then have something like this:

![Kafka](./images/kc21.png)

Next, copy your full experience event to your clipboard. The whitespace of your JSON payload needs to be stripped and we'll use an online tool to do that. Go to [http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/](http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/) to do that.

![Kafka](./images/kc22.png)

Paste your experience event into the editor and click **Remove white space**.

![Kafka](./images/kc22a.png)

Next, select all of the output text and copy it to your clipboard.

![Kafka](./images/kc23.png)

Go back to your Terminal window.

![Kafka](./images/kc16.png)

Paste the new payload without whitespaces into the Terminal window and click **Enter**.

![Kafka](./images/kc23a.png)

Next, go back to your demo website and refresh the page. You should now see an experience event on your profile, under **Other Events**, just like the one below:

![Kafka](./images/kc24.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you want your call center interactions to appear on the Profile Viewer panel, you need to add the below label and filter in your project on [https://builder.adobedemo.com/projects](https://builder.adobedemo.com/projects), by going to the tab **Profile Viewer**.

![Kafka](./images/kc25.png)

You have finished this exercise.
