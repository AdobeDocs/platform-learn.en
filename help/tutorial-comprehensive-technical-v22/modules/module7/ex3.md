# 7.3 Update your Data Collection property and test your journey

## 7.3.1 Update your Data Collection property

Go to [Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection](https://experience.adobe.com/launch/) and select **Tags**.

This is the Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection Properties page you saw before.

![Properties page](../module1/images/launch1.png) 

In module 0, Demo System created two Client properties for you: one for the website and one for the mobile app. Find them by searching for `--demoProfileLdap--` in the **[!UICONTROL Search]** box. Click to open the **Web** property.

![Search box](../module1/images/property6.png)

You'll then see this.

![Launch Setup](./images/rule1.png)

In the left menu, go to **Rules** and search for the rule **Register profile**. Click the rule **Register profile** to open it.

![Launch Setup](./images/rule2.png)

You'll then see the details of this rule. Click to open the action **Send "Registration Event" to AEP - trigger JO**.

![Launch Setup](./images/rule3.png)

You'll then see that when this action is triggered, a specific data element is used to define the XDM data structure. You need to update that data element, and you need to define the **Event ID** of the event that you configured in [Exercise 7.1](./ex1.md).

![Launch Setup](./images/rule4.png)

You now need to go update the data element **XDM - Registration Event**. To do so, go to **Data Elements**. Search for **XDM - Registration Event** and click to open that data element.

![Launch Setup](./images/rule5.png)

You'll then see this:

![Launch Setup](./images/rule6.png)

Navigate to the field `_experience.campaign.orchestration.eventID`. Remove the current value, and paste your eventID there.

As a reminder, the Event ID can be found in Adobe Journey Optimizer under **Configurations > Events** and you'll find the event ID in the sample payload of your even, which looks like this: `"eventID": "227402c540eb8f8855c6b2333adf6d54d7153d9d7d56fa475a6866081c574736"`.

![ACOP](./images/payloadeventID.png)

After pasting your eventID, your screen should look like this. Next, click **Save** or **Save to Library**.

![Launch Setup](./images/rule7.png)

Finally, you need to publish your changes. Go to **Publishing Flow** in the left menu.

![Launch Setup](./images/rule8.png)

Click **Add All Changed Resources** and then click **Save & Build to Development**.

![Launch Setup](./images/rule9.png)

Your library will then be updated and after 1-2 minutes you can then go ahead and test your configuration.
