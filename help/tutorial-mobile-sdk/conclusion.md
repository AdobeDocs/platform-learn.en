# Conclusion and next steps

Congratulations! You have completed the "Implement Adobe Experience Cloud in mobile apps" tutorial!

Let's quickly review all that you have accomplished. You have:

* Created a schema using standard and custom field groups.
* Set up a datastream.
* Configured a mobile tag property.
* Installed and implemented tag extensions in an app.
* Implemented the following capabilities in an app:
  * Consent
  * Lifecycle data
  * Event tracking
  * Identity
  * Profile
* Correctly passed Experience Cloud parameters to a webview.
* Validated the implementation using Adobe Experience Platform Assurance.
* Connected the implementation to the following Experience Cloud applications:
  * Adobe Analytics
  * Experience Platform
  * Journey Optimizer

You are ready to begin the next phase of your journey&mdash;implementing Adobe Experience Cloud in your own mobile app!

And there is always more to learn! Here are some suggestions of other content to build upon your implementation:

* **Enable event forwarding**. Event forwarding can easily be enabled in your datastream. Here is [a hands-on lesson to configure event forwarding](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/implement-web-sdk/event-forwarding/setup-event-forwarding.html) from the Web SDK tutorial. Just use the resources created for your mobile implementation and choose XDM fields that you implemented in the app.
* **Trigger a journey in Journey Optimizer**. The events you implemented in the Luma app can be used to trigger journeys. Learn more in this [video tutorial](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer-learn/tutorials/create-journeys/use-case-transactional-journey.html).
* **Connect Customer Journey Analytics**. If you created the [Platform dataset](platform.md), you can connect the dataset to Customer Journey Analytics. Learn more in this [video tutorial](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/customer-journey-analytics-learn/tutorials/connecting-customer-journey-analytics-to-data-sources-in-platform.html)
* **Enable Audience Manager** Enable Audience Manager in your datastream to send your XDM Experience Events and start building segments based on mobile app engagement.
* **Implement Adobe Target**. Target is now supported with datastream configurations linked to a mobile property, and can be implemented using the [Adobe Journey Optimizer - Decisioning extension](https://developer.adobe.com/client-sdks/documentation/adobe-journey-optimizer-decisioning/).
* **Build a segment in Platform**. If you enabled your [schema and dataset for Real-Time Customer Profile](platform.md), you can build segments based on your mobile app events, combine them with data from other sources and then send these segments to destinations in Real-Time Customer Data Platform. Learn more about the segment builder in this [video tutorial](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/segments/create-segments.html).
* **Implement Platform Web SDK**. Now that you've mastered one SDK, learn another! The Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK is the JavaScript SDK used to power Experience Cloud and third-party services on websites. There is a similar [hands-on tutorial for Web SDK](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/implement-web-sdk/overview.html). Complete both and see profiles merge across devices!
* **Learn more about Experience Platform**. Learn more about how to ingest data from other sources and combine that with your Mobile SDK data, in [Getting Started with Adobe Experience Platform for Data Architects and Data Engineers](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/getting-started-for-data-architects-and-data-engineers/overview.html)
