# Experience Makers Bootcamp

## Overview

Many organizations aren't aware of the friction that exist in their customers’ journey, which is the consequence of a siloed and fragmented approach in orchestrating customer communication. Data, Profile and Content need to be perfectly aligned to design and deliver exceptional customer experiences.

Join this bootcamp to learn how a platform-based approach can help you get the insights needed to identify and remove friction points to improve your customer's journey.

Personalisation at scale starts with understanding what can be improved, and a real-time view of your customer is critical to this. Insights lead to action, which leads to more insights. Adobe’s unique platform-centric approach gives you the tools to not only drive technological change, but also impact your organization, your team, and your ability to deliver a holistic customer experience instead of a channel-specific customer experience.
