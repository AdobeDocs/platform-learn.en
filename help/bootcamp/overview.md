# Experience Makers Bootcamp

## Overview

Many organizations aren't aware of the friction that exist in their customers’ journey, which is the consequence of a siloed and fragmented approach in orchestrating customer communication. Data, Profile and Content need to be perfectly aligned to design and deliver exceptional customer experiences.

Join this bootcamp to learn how a platform-based approach can help you get the insights needed to identify and remove friction points to improve your customer's journey.

Personalisation at scale starts with understanding what can be improved, and a real-time view of your customer is critical to this. Insights lead to action, which leads to more insights. Adobe’s unique platform-centric approach gives you the tools to not only drive technological change, but also impact your organization, your team, and your ability to deliver a holistic customer experience instead of a channel-specific customer experience.

## Architecture

Before you start with the hands-on exercises, have a look at the architecture behind this tutorial. This bootcamp will go deep on a number of features and functionalities around Adobe Experience Platform, and will also discuss multiple integrations across a variety of sources and destinations.

## Videos

The main objective of our Experience Makers Bootcamp is to help organisations understand what personalization at scale means and how it is very different from what most organisations are doing today. To deliver customer experiences that are consistent, contextual and real-time in an omni-channel world, you need a platform-first mindset where you define everything just once and reuse it everywhere. In the bootcamp, we take you on a real journey that combines customer interactions across website, mobile app, call center and and offline, in-store environment to showcase what personalization at scale really means, in a hands-on way.
