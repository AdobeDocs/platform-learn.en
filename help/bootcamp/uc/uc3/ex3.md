In this exercise, you'll configure the journey that needs to be triggered when someone creates an account on the demo website.

You'll be redirected to the **Home**  view in Journey Optimizer. First, make sure you're using the correct sandbox. The sandbox to use is called `Bootcamp`. To change from one sandbox to another, click on **Prod** and select the sandbox from the list. In this example, the sandbox is named **Bootcamp**. You'll then be in the **Home** view of your sandbox `Bootcamp`.
