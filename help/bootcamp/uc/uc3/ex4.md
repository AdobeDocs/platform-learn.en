To test your journey, you'll need to use the event ID of the event you created in exercise 3.2, which looks like this.

The event ID is what needs to be sent to Adobe Experience Platform in order to trigger the journey. In this example, the eventID is:
`e76c0bf0c77c3517e5b6f4c457a0754ebaf5f1f6b9357d74e0d8e13ae517c3d5`.

Open the mobile app and go to the homepage. Click the **Settings** icon.
