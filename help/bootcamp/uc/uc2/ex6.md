# 2.6 Install & use the mobile app


## Install the mobile app

Ask your Adobe representative to get access to the mobile application. The mobile application is available only for iOS and is available through Apple's Testflight app, so you need to install the TestFlight app first. Your Adobe representative will then provide you with access to the mobile app, after which you'll receive an invite like this one to accept an invitiation to join App Store Connect:
