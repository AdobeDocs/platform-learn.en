## Context

The journey from unknown to known is one of the most important topics amongst brands these days, as is the customer journey from acquisition to retention. 

Adobe Experience Platform plays a huge role in this journey. Platform is the brains for communication, the **experience system of record**.

Platform is an environment in which the word customer is broader than just the known customers. An unknown visitor on the website is also a customer from Platform's perspective and as such, all of the behavior as an unknown visitor is also sent to Platform. Thanks to that approach, when this visitor eventually becomes a known customer, a brand can visualize what happened before that moment as well. This helps from an attribution and experience optimization perspective.
