# Stack tag rules

Learn how to stack rules a tag property. Rule stacking uses the `order` feature in tag rule events to sequence rules so you can manage scalable tag implementations. Set some variables in a global rule, add and overwrite variables in a page-specific rule, and then send the data to the desired marketing application. For more information on rule ordering, see the [rules](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/ui/rules.html#rule-ordering) documentation.
