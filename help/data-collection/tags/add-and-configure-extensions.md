# Add and configure tag extensions

Learn how to add and configure extensions in your tag property. Extensions are pre-packaged "apps" you install on your site to give you the tracking, personalization, or other capabilities you need. The extension marketplace is always growing, as Adobe, partners, and customers create extensions to power use cases. For more information, see the [extensions](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/ui/extensions/overview.html) documentation.
