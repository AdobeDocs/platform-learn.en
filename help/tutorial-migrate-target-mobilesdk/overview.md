# Migrate from the Adobe Target to the Adobe Journey Optimizer - Decisioning Mobile extension

This guide is for experienced Adobe Target implementers to learn how to migrate existing Adobe Experience Platfrom Mobile SDK implementations from the Adobe Target extension to the Adobe Journey Optimizer - Decisioning extension.

Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK powers end-to-end engagement in your mobile applications. The Target extension builds on the Mobile SDK to help you personalize app experiences with Adobe Target. The Decisioning extension is a newer approach to implement Adobe Target in mobile apps that uses Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network capabilities that help integrate Target with Platform-based apps such as Real-Time CDP and Journey Optimizer.

## Key benefits

Some of the benefits of the Decisioning extension include:

* Faster sharing of audiences from [Real-Time Customer Data Platform](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/experience-cloud/next-hit-personalization.html)
* Integrating Target with Journey Optimizer to support [Offer Decisioning delivery](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/integrate/ajo/offer-decision.html)
* A tighter integration with Adobe Analytics which does not rely on stitching information from separate network calls
* Additional implementation flexibility for developers

Arguably, the largest benefit to Target customers of migrating is for integration with Real-Time Customer Data Platform. Real-Time CDP offers tremendous audience-building capabilities based on the full range of data ingested into Experience Platform and its Real-time Customer Profile capability. A built-in data governance framework, automates responsible use of that data. Customer AI allows you to easily use machine learning models to construct propensity and churn models whose output can be shared back to Adobe Target. And finally, customers of the optional Healthcare and Privacy & Security Shield addons can use the consent enforcement feature to easily enforce individual customers' consent preferences. Platform Web SDK is a requirement to use these Real-Time CDP features in your web channel.
