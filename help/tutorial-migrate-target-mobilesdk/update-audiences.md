# Update Target audiences and profile scripts for Platform Web SDK compatibility


## Adjust audiences


For more information and best practices, refer to the dedicated documentation about [profile scripts](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/audiences/visitor-profiles/profile-parameters.html). 

## Update parameter tokens for dynamic content



If you choose to make adjustments after the migration to account for the new XDM mbox parameter names, be sure to pause any impacted activities during the migration event to prevent activity display errors to visitors.

Next, learn how to [validate the Target implementation](validate.md).
