# Validate the Adobe Journey Optimizer - Decisioning Mobile extension implementation

After you have migrated your Target implementation from the Target extension to the Decisioning extension, it's important to validate everything is working properly before publishing any changes to your production app. Adobe recommends the following, which is covered in detail on this page:

* Perform a technical validation to make sure the basic implementation and Platform Mobile SDK requests and responses look correct
* Ensure that Target activities are delivered and rendered properly
* Check that reporting works correctly
* Revisit audiences and profile scripts to make sure they are compatible with Platform Mobile SDK and the Optimie extension
* Ensure integrations with Adobe or third-party applications work correctly 

Every Target implementation is different depending on site architecture and features used. You may use the tables below as a starting point and add any items unique to your implementation. The [Debugging page](debugging.md) of this tutorial shows you tools you can use to help with this validation.

## Technical validation

## Integrations with Adobe applications

After performing the validation steps above, you can be confident that the Platform Mobile SDK implementation with the Decisioning extension is ready to move to production.

Next, learn how to [troubleshoot a Target implementation using Platform Web SDK](debugging.md).
