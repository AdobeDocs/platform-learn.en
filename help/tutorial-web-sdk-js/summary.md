# Summary

If you reached this far, congratulations! You've successfully performed a simple implementation of sending data from your website into Adobe Experience Platform!

In this tutorial, you learned:

* How to create a dataset for storing your data.
* How to create a schema for describing and validating your data.
* How to create a datastream for enabling products and directing where events should be sent once they reach the server.
* How to install Adobe Client Data Layer onto a simple webpage.
* How to push events and data into Adobe Client Data Layer.
* How to build rules and data elements inside Adobe Experience Platform Tags to send data to Adobe Experience Platform Edge.
* How to deploy a tag library.
* How to test your implementation.

The tools we've covered don't all have to be used together. For example, you can use Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK without Tags or without the Adobe Client Data Layer. You can bring your own data layer or a different tag manager, but we recommend using Adobe's tools for a more seamless experience. 

We hope this has been insightful. Now go build something amazing!
