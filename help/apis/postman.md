# Use Postman with Experience Platform APIs

[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is a tool allowing developers to quickly and easily interact with Adobe Experience Platform APIs.

## Export Details to Postman

Adobe I/O Console's **Export Details for Postman** capability provides an easy way to export all the account details required to access and interact with an Experience Platform API in a single Postman Environment file, removing the need to copy and paste values from the Adobe I/O Console into Postman.
