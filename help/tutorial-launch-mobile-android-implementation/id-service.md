# Add the Adobe Experience Platform Identity Service

The [Adobe Experience Platform Identity Service](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/id-service/using/home.html) sets a common visitor id across all Adobe solutions in order to power Experience Cloud capabilities such as audience-sharing between solutions.  You can also send your own customer ids to the Service to enable cross-device targeting and integrations with your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system.

The Identity Service is part of the Mobile Core extension, ***so you have already implemented it when you installed the Mobile SDK***! At present time, this tutorial does not include instructions for setting Customer Ids. Please see the documentation for details on [how to set Customer Ids](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/using-mobile-extensions/mobile-core/identity/identity-api-reference).

## Validation Steps

To validate the calls to the Identity Service, run the sample app in Android Studio, open the Debug Console and look for the request and the response:

1. **Request to the Identity Service** (filter Logcat to `IdentityExtension`) In this example, the ID (`d_mid`)has already been set and is just being reported up again)

    ```java
    03-14 17:01:18.526 7743-7803/com.adobe.busbooking D/ADBMobile: IdentityExtension - Sending request (https://dpm.demdex.net/id?d_mid=59651426340521082405908216148091920022&d_ver=2&d_orgid=7ABB3E6A5A7491460A495D61%40AdobeOrg)
    ```

1. **Response from the Identity Service** (filter Logcat to `IdentityExtension`). Note how the `mid` value matches the `d_mid` value in the request above:

    ```java
    03-14 17:01:19.033 7743-7803/com.adobe.busbooking D/ADBMobile: IdentityExtension - Received ID response (mid: 59651426340521082405908216148091920022, blob: j8Odv6LonN4r3an7LhD3WZrU1bUpAkFkkiY1ncBR96t2PTI, hint: 9, ttl: 604800
    ```
