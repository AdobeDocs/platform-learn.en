# Authenticate and access [!DNL Experience Platform] APIs

This document provides a step-by-step tutorial for gaining access to an Adobe Experience Platform developer account in order to make calls to [!DNL Experience Platform] APIs. 

## Authenticate to make API calls

To maintain the security of your applications and users, all requests to Adobe I/O APIs must be authenticated and authorized using standards such as OAuth and JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The JWT is then used along with client-specific information to generate your personal access token.

This tutorial covers the steps of authentication through the creation of an access token outlined in the following flowchart:

## Prerequisites

In order to successfully make calls to [!DNL Experience Platform] APIs, you require the following:

* An IMS Organization with access to Adobe Experience Platform
* A registered Adobe ID account
* An Admin Console administrator to add you as a **developer** and a **user** for a product.

The following sections walk through the steps to create an Adobe ID and become a developer and user for an organization.

### Create an Adobe ID

If you do not have an Adobe ID, you can create one using the following steps:

1. Go to [Adobe Developer Console](https://console.adobe.io)
2. Click **[!UICONTROL create a new account]**
3. Complete the sign up process

## Become a developer and user for [!DNL Experience Platform] for an organization

Before creating integrations on Adobe I/O, your account must have developer permissions for a product in an IMS Organization. Detailed information about developer accounts on the Admin Console can be found in the [support document](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/manage-developers.html) for managing developers.

**Gain developer access**

Contact an [!DNL Admin Console] administrator in your Organization to add you as a developer for one of your Organization's products using the [[!DNL Admin Console]](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/).

The administrator must assign you as a developer to at least one product profile to proceed.

Once you are assigned as a developer, you will have access privileges to create integrations on [Adobe I/O](https://www.adobe.com/go/devs_console_ui). These integrations are a pipeline from external apps and services to the Adobe API.

**Gain user access**

Your [!DNL Admin Console] administrator must also add you to the product as a user.

Similar to the process for adding a developer, the administrator must assign you to at least one product profile in order to proceed.

## Generate access credentials in Adobe Developer Console

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you are following this document from the [Privacy Service developer guide](http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy-getting-started-en), you can now return to that guide to generate the access credentials unique to [!DNL Privacy Service].

Using Adobe Developer Console, you must generate the following three access credentials:

* `{IMS_ORG}`
* `{API_KEY}`
* `{ACCESS_TOKEN}`

Your `{IMS_ORG}` and `{API_KEY}` only need to be generated once and can be reused in future [!DNL Platform] API calls. However, your `{ACCESS_TOKEN}` is temporary and must be regenerated every 24 hours.

The steps are covered in detail below.

### One-time setup

Go to [Adobe Developer Console](https://www.adobe.com/go/devs_console_ui) and sign in with your Adobe ID. Next, follow the steps outlined in the tutorial on [creating an empty project](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/console/docs.html#!AdobeDocs/adobeio-console/master/projects-empty.md) in the Adobe Developer Console documentation.

Once you have created a new project, click **[!UICONTROL Add API]** on the _Project Overview_ screen.

![](../assets/authentication/add-api-button.png)

The _Add an API_ screen appears. Click the product icon for Adobe Experience Platform, then select **[!UICONTROL Experience Platform API]** before clicking **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

![](../assets/authentication/add-platform-api.png)

Once you have selected [!DNL Experience Platform] as the API to be added to the project, follow the steps outlined in the tutorial on [adding an API to a project using a service account (JWT)](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/console/docs.html#!AdobeDocs/adobeio-console/master/services-add-api-jwt.md) (starting from the "Configure API" step) to finish the process. 

Once the API has been added to the project, the _Project overview_ page displays the following credentials that are required in all calls to [!DNL Experience Platform] APIs:

* `{API_KEY}` (Client ID)
* `{IMS_ORG}` (Organization ID)

![](./../assets/authentication/api-key-ims-org.png)

### Authentication for each session

The final required credential you must gather is your `{ACCESS_TOKEN}`. Unlike the values for `{API_KEY}` and `{IMS_ORG}`, a new token must be generated every 24 hours to continue using [!DNL Platform] APIs.

To generate a new `{ACCESS_TOKEN}`, follow the steps to [generate a JWT token](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/console/docs.html#!AdobeDocs/adobeio-console/master/credentials.md) in the Developer Console credentials guide.

## Test access credentials

Once you have gathered all three required credentials, you can try to make the following API call. This call will list all [!DNL Experience Data Model] (XDM) classes within the Schema Registry's `global` container:

**API format**

```http
GET /global/classes
```

**Request**

```SHELL
curl -X GET https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/schemaregistry/global/classes \
  -H 'Accept: application/vnd.adobe.xed-id+json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}'
```

**Response**

If your response is similar to the one shown below, then your credentials are valid and working. (This response has been truncated for space.)

```JSON
{
  "results": [
    {
        "title": "XDM ExperienceEvent",
        "$id": "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/experienceevent",
        "meta:altId": "_xdm.context.experienceevent",
        "version": "1"
    },
    {
        "title": "XDM Individual Profile",
        "$id": "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile",
        "meta:altId": "_xdm.context.profile",
        "version": "1"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Use Postman for JWT authentication and API calls

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is a popular tool to work with RESTful APIs. This [Medium post](https://medium.com/adobetech/using-postman-for-jwt-authentication-on-adobe-i-o-7573428ffe7f) describes how you can set up postman to automatically perform JWT authentication and use it to consume Adobe Experience Platform APIs.

## Next steps

By reading this document, you have gathered and successfully tested your access credentials for [!DNL Platform] APIs. You can now follow along with the example API calls provided throughout the [documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform.html).

In addition to the authentication values you have gathered in this tutorial, many [!DNL Platform] APIs also require a valid `{SANDBOX_NAME}` to be provided as a header. See the [sandboxes overview](https://adobe.com/go/sandbox-overview-en) for more information.
